AB  - The protection of artistic and cultural heritage is a major challenge due to its peculiarities and its exposure to significant natural hazards. Several methodologies exist to assess the condition of artistic heritage and to protect it from exceptional actions. Moreover, novel digital technologies offer many solutions able to deliver a digital replica of artifacts of interest, so that a reduction in the uncertainties in the analysis models can be achieved. A rational approach to the preservation and protection of artistic heritage is based on traditional approaches supported and integrated by novel technologies, so that qualitative and quantitative indicators of the current condition of artistic heritage can be defined and validated in an interdisciplinary framework. The present paper reports the results of an approach to the maintenance and preservation of art objects housed in a museum complex based on a comprehensive digital path towards a Historical Digital Twin (HDT). A workflow aimed at estimating the stress regime and the dynamic properties of two sculptures, based on the detailed three-dimensional model resulting from a laser scanner survey, is illustrated and discussed. The results highlight the great advantages resulting from the integration of traditional and novel procedures in the field of conservation of artistic assets.

AB  - The possibility of performing complex data analysis through sets of cooperating personal smart devices has recently encouraged the definition of new distributed computing paradigms. The general idea behind these approaches is to move early analysis towards the edge of the network, while relying on other intermediate (fog) or remote (cloud) devices for computations of increasing complexity. Unfortunately, because both of their distributed nature and high degree of modularity, edge-fog-cloud computing systems are particularly prone to cyber security attacks that can be performed against every element of the infrastructure. In order to address this issue, in this paper we present SMCP, a Secure Mobile Crowdsensing Protocol for fog-based applications that exploit lightweight encryption techniques that are particularly suited for low-power mobile edge devices. In order to assess the performance of the proposed security mechanisms, we consider as case study a distributed human activity recognition scenario in which machine learning algorithms are performed by users’ personal smart devices at the edge and fog layers. The functionalities provided by SMCP have been directly compared with two state-of-the-art security protocols. Results show that our approach allows to achieve a higher degree of security while maintaining a low computational cost.

AB  - Introduction: Nano-titanium dioxide (TiO2), a prominently utilized engineered nanomaterial (ENM), is being employed for its physiochemical properties in several fields including the food industry, manufacturing, and biomedicine. As the prevalence of this ENM, and other particulate matter grows, so does the concern for antagonistic consequences on long-term heart function in vulnerable populations, which until now have not been investigated. Due to the reliance of the heart on the ATP generating capacity of mitochondria for contraction, understanding the role of mitochondrial bioenergetics and structure is pivotal in understanding the repercussions of particulate matter exposure during gestation. As the mass population in cities, where particulate matter exposure is highest, do not have many options for mitigating their exposure, it is of utmost importance that strategies are developed that limit the detriments associated with xenobiotic exposure. Understanding the mechanisms, both epigenetic and epitranscriptomic, that regulate mitochondrial and cardiac function under these circumstances will allow for a better understanding of potential therapeutic or preventative strategies and mitigate the disease burden related to particulate matter exposure each year. The purpose of this compilation of work is to identify the mechanisms contributing to the acute and chronic pathological effects of ENM inhalation exposure during gestation as a prerequisite to developing strategies to reduce risks to public health.

AB  - In recent years, freeform three-dimensional (3D) printing has led to significant advances in the fabrication of artificial tissues with vascularized structures. This technique utilizes a supporting matrix that holds the extruded printing ink and ensures shape maintenance of the printed 3D constructs within the prescribed spatial precision. Since the printing nozzle can be translated omnidirectionally within the supporting matrix, freeform 3D printing is potentially applicable for the fabrication of complex 3D objects, incorporating curved, and irregular shaped vascular networks. To optimize freeform 3D printing quality and performance, the rheological properties of the printing ink and supporting matrix, and the material matching between them are of paramount importance. In this review, we shall compare conventional 3D printing and freeform 3D printing technologies for the fabrication of vascular constructs, and critically discuss their working principles and their advantages and disadvantages. We also provide the detailed material information of emerging printing inks and supporting matrices in recent freeform 3D printing studies. The accompanying challenges are further discussed, aiming to guide freeform 3D printing by the effective design and selection of the most appropriate materials/processes for the development of full-scale functional vascularized artificial tissues.

AB  - <AbstractText Label="PURPOSE" NlmCategory="OBJECTIVE">The aim of this investigation was to evaluate the accuracy of various skeletal and dental cephalometric parameters as produced by different commercial providers that make use of artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted automated cephalometric analysis and to compare their quality to a gold standard established by orthodontic experts.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="METHODS" NlmCategory="METHODS">Twelve experienced orthodontic examiners pinpointed 15 radiographic landmarks on a total of 50 cephalometric X‑rays. The landmarks were used to generate 9 parameters for orthodontic treatment planning. The "humans' gold standard" was defined by calculating the median value of all 12 human assessments for each parameter, which in turn served as reference values for comparisons with results given by four different commercial providers of automated cephalometric analyses (DentaliQ.ortho [CellmatiQ GmbH, Hamburg, Germany], WebCeph [AssembleCircle Corp, Seongnam-si, Korea], AudaxCeph [Audax d.o.o., Ljubljana, Slovenia], CephX [Orca Dental AI, Herzliya, Israel]). Repeated measures analysis of variances (ANOVAs) were calculated and Bland-Altman plots were generated for comparisons.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="RESULTS">The results of the repeated measures ANOVAs indicated significant differences between the commercial providers' predictions and the humans' gold standard for all nine investigated parameters. However, the pairwise comparisons also demonstrate that there were major differences among the four commercial providers. While there were no significant mean differences between the values of DentaliQ.ortho and the humans' gold standard, the predictions of AudaxCeph showed significant deviations in seven out of nine parameters. Also, the Bland-Altman plots demonstrate that a reduced precision of AI predictions must be expected especially for values attributed to the inclination of the incisors.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="CONCLUSION" NlmCategory="CONCLUSIONS">Fully automated cephalometric analyses are promising in terms of timesaving and avoidance of individual human errors. At present, however, they should only be used under supervision of experienced clinicians.</AbstractText>

AB  - Football is a sport that has the most fans in the world. What makes sebak patterns so popular are their uncertain and unpredictable results. There are many factors that affect the outcome of a football match, including strategy, skill, and even luck. Therefore, guessing the results of a soccer match is an interesting problem. All shots are grouped into sections on the playing field and theoretical goal scores are applied to each area. The factors analyzed are: distance of shot from goal and angle of shot in relation to goal. When calculating xG, it is recommended that the distance and angle of the shot are important. The combination of the two xG factors is better calculated than each variable only. In addition, this xG check has been able to relatively accurately identify the mid-table teams that score and concede goals.

AB  - Due to energy limitation and high operational costs, it is likely that exascale computing will not be achieved by one or two datacentres but will require many more. A simple calculation, which aggregates the computation power of the 2017 Top500 supercomputers, can only reach 418 petaflops. Companies like Rescale, which claims 1.4 exaflops of peak computing power, describes its infrastructure as composed of 8 million servers spread across 30 datacentres. Any proposed solution to address exascale computing challenges has to take into consideration these facts and by design should aim to support the use of geographically distributed and likely independent datacentres. It should also consider, whenever possible, the co-allocation of the storage with the computation as it would take 3 years to transfer 1 exabyte on a dedicated 100 Gb Ethernet connection. This means we have to be smart about managing data more and more geographically dispersed and spread across different administrative domains. As the natural settings of the PROCESS project is to operate within the European Research Infrastructure and serve the European research communities facing exascale challenges, it is important that PROCESS architecture and solutions are well positioned within the European computing and data management landscape namely PRACE, EGI, and EUDAT. In this paper we propose a scalable and programmable data infrastructure that is easy to deploy and can be tuned to support various data-intensive scientific applications.

AB  - Blockchain is a decentralized distributed ledger technology. The public chain represented by Bitcoin and Ethereum only realizes the limited anonymity of user identity, and the transaction amount is open to the whole network, resulting in user privacy leakage. Based on the existing anonymous technology, the concealment of the sender, receiver, amount of the transaction, and does not disclose any information, which makes the supervision difficult. Therefore, the design of blockchain scheme with privacy protection and supervision functions is of great significance. In this paper, a blockchain transaction model with both privacy and supervision function is proposed. It uses probability encryption to realize the hiding of the true identity of the blockchain transaction, and uses the commitment scheme and zero-knowledge proof technology to realize the privacy protection and guarantee legitimacy verification of the transaction. With the use of encryption technology, the regulators can supervise blockchain transactions without storing the users' information, which greatly reduces the pressure on storage, computing and key management. In addition, it does not rely on specific consensus mechanism and can be used as an independent module. The security performance analysis shows that the proposed scheme has great practicability and has potential application in many fields.

AB  - Weakly supervised learning aims at coping with scarce labeled data. Previous weakly supervised studies typically assume that there is only one kind of weak supervision in data. In many applications, however, raw data usually contains more than one kind of weak supervision at the same time. For example, in user experience enhancement from Didi, one of the largest online ride-sharing platforms, the ride comment data contains severe label noise (due to the subjective factors of passengers) and severe label distribution bias (due to the sampling bias). We call such a problem as ‘compound weakly supervised learning’. In this paper, we propose the CWSL method to address this problem based on Didi ride-sharing comment data. Specifically, an instance reweighting strategy is employed to cope with severe label noise in comment data, where the weights for harmful noisy instances are small. Robust criteria like AUC rather than accuracy and the validation performance are optimized for the correction of biased data label. Alternating optimization and stochastic gradient methods accelerate the optimization on large-scale data. Experiments on Didi ride-sharing comment data clearly validate the effectiveness. We hope this work may shed some light on applying weakly supervised learning to complex real situations.

AB  - Aluminium ladders are popular tools used in many fields of industry and construction. Their completeness and durability are key to ensure work safety and avoid dangerous scenarios. To provide safety to aluminium ladders, it is necessary to perform completion checks and measurements of ladder deformation are necessary during operation. This article presents a measurement system to assess the completeness of aluminium ladders and describes the use of the GOM Pontos system to measure the deformation of the ladder during operation. The main purpose of the research was to verify whether the system proposed by the authors works successfully and the results obtained allow it to be deployed in the production line. Research results and conclusions can provide a basis for further research and may help improve the production and utilisation processes of aluminium ladders. The research was carried out in a company that is engaged in the production of aluminium ladders. This allowed a thorough examination of the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed methods under real production conditions, which is crucial for the practical implementation of this technology in the industry.

AB  - With the continuous development of medical image informatics technology, more and more high-throughput quantitative data could be extracted from digital medical images, which has resulted in a new kind of omics-Radiomics. In recent years, in addition to genomics, proteomics and metabolomics, radiomic has attracted the interest of more and more researchers. Compared to other omics, radiomics can be perfectly integrated with clinical data, even with the pathology and molecular biomarker, so that the study can be closer to the clinical reality and more revealing of the tumor development. Mass data will also be generated in this process. Machine learning, due to its own characteristics, has a unique advantage in processing massive radiomic data. By analyzing mass amounts of data with strong clinical relevance, people can construct models that more accurately reflect tumor development and progression, thereby providing the possibility of personalized and sequential treatment of patients. As one of the cancer types whose treatment and diagnosis rely on imaging examination, radiomics has a very broad application prospect in head and neck cancers (HNC). Until now, there have been some notable results in HNC. In this review, we will introduce the concepts and workflow of radiomics and machine learning and their current applications in head and neck cancers, as well as the directions and applications of artificial intelligence in the treatment and diagnosis of HNC.

AB  - Recognizing potentially hazardous objects is crucial in the field of transportation, especially in assisted and unmanned driving. However, most existing studies do not focus on defensive driving as they only identify accidents ahead of the vehicle in which they are not involved. In this paper, a driving assistance system is proposed to predict the risk score of potential targets ahead of the vehicle and provide an early warning, which relies on a deep architecture called Fusion-Residual Predictive Network (FRPN) that fused multi-scale residual features and improved adversarial learning. This architecture provides an environment for the generator to perform joint learning from ground-truth images and discriminators with gradient penalty constraints. The deeper convolutional neural network can greatly improve the quality of the image by fusing residual features. Several deep convolutional neural network models were used to evaluate the method on various datasets; among them, the prediction model based on the VGG network, with peak signal-to-noise ratio of 32.67 and structural similarity index of 0.921, respectively, yielded the best results. Subsequently, we utilize the tracking model to design a risk score evaluation method based on the location of the target and it have an improvement in ability to give early warning with 1.95s earlier in the best case. These results prove that our method can effectively reduce the risk of traffic accidents.

AB  - In recent times, severe acute malnutrition (SAM) in India is considered a serious issue as per UNICEF 2022 records. In that record, 35.5% of children under age 5 are stunted, 19.3% are wasted, and 32% are underweight. Malnutrition, defined as these three conditions, affects 5.7 million children globally. This research utilizes an artificial intelligence-based image segmentation technique to predict malnutrition in children. The primary goal of this research is to use a deep learning model to eliminate the need for multiple manual diagnostic tests and simplify the prediction of malnutrition in kids. The traditional model uses text-based data and takes more time with continuous monitoring of kids by analysing body mass index (BMI) over different periods. Children in rural areas often miss medical expert appointments, and a lack of knowledge among parents can lead to severe malnutrition. The aim of the proposed system is to eliminate the need for manual blood tests and regular visits to medical experts. This study uses the ResNet-50 deep learning model's built-in shortcut connection to solve the image-based vanishing gradient problem. This makes training more efficient for image segmentation tasks in predicting malnutrition. The model is 98.49% accurate in predicting the kids who are malnourished among the kids who are healthy. It is evident from the results that the proposed system serves better than other deep learning models, such as XG Boost (75.29% accuracy), VGG 16 (94% accuracy), Xception (95.41% accuracy), and MobileNet (92.42% accuracy). Hence, the proposed technique is effective in detecting malnutrition and diagnose it earlier, without using predictive analysis function or advice from the medical experts.

AB  - Taking advantage of the high-throughput genotyping technology of Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP), Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWASs) have been successfully implemented for defining the relative role of genes and the environment in disease risk, assisting in enabling preventative and precision medicine. However, current multi-locus-based methods are insufficient in terms of computational cost and discrimination power to detect statistically significant interactions with different genetic effects on multifarious diseases. Statistical tests for multi-locus interactions (≥2 SNPs) raise huge analytical challenges because computational cost increases exponentially as the growth of the cardinality of SNPs in an interaction module. In this paper, we develop a simple, fast, and powerful method, named JS-MA, based on Jensen-Shannon divergence and agglomerative hierarchical clustering, to detect the genome-wide multi-locus interactions associated with multiple diseases. From the systematical simulation, JS-MA is more powerful and efficient compared with the state-of-the-art association mapping tools. JS-MA was applied to the real GWAS datasets for two common diseases, i.e., Rheumatoid Arthritis and Type 1 Diabetes. The results showed that JS-MA not only confirmed recently reported, biologically meaningful associations, but also identified novel multi-locus interactions. Therefore, we believe that JS-MA is suitable and efficient for a full-scale analysis of multi-disease-related interactions in the large GWASs.

AB  - This study investigates the effectiveness of Abrasive Water Suspension Jet (AWSJ) Machining, a non-conventional erosion-based method, for machining carbon fiber-reinforced polymer (CFRP) composites. The focus was on analyzing key process parameters-abrasive size, feed rate, and standoff distance (SOD)-under submerged cutting conditions and their impact on material removal rate (MRR), kerf width, and surface roughness. Experimental trials were conducted, and advanced computational techniques, including Response Surface Methodology (RSM), Random Forest (RF), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), were used for parameter optimization and predictive analysis. The results showed that submerged cutting significantly improved machining quality by reducing surface roughness and ensuring uniform kerf widths. Increasing the jet diameter in underwater conditions stabilized the nozzle, leading to smoother and more precise cuts. Among the predictive models, XGBoost demonstrated the highest accuracy and efficiency in forecasting MRR, while Random Forest and ANN provided competitive performance. The integration of RSM and machine learning (ML) techniques enabled effective optimization of machining parameters, showcasing the potential for cost-effective and high-precision CFRP machining. These findings are particularly relevant for industries like aerospace and automotive, where machining efficiency and precision are crucial.

AB  - Stroke has become a leading cause of death and long-term disability in the world, and there is no effective treatment.Deep learning-based approaches have the potential to outperform existing stroke risk prediction models, they rely on large well-labeled data. Due to the strict privacy protection policy in health-care systems, stroke data is usually distributed among different hospitals in small pieces. In addition, the positive and negative instances of such data are extremely imbalanced. Transfer learning solves small data issue by exploiting the knowledge of a correlated domain, especially when multiple source are available.In this work, we propose a novel Hybrid Deep Transfer Learning-based Stroke Risk Prediction (HDTL-SRP) scheme to exploit the knowledge structure from multiple correlated sources (i.e.,external stroke data, chronic diseases data, such as hypertension and diabetes). The proposed framework has been extensively tested in synthetic and real-world scenarios, and it outperforms the state-of-the-art stroke risk prediction models. It also shows the potential of real-world deployment among multiple hospitals aided with 5G/B5G infrastructures.

AB  - It is essential for autonomous vehicles at level 3 or higher to have the ability to predict the trajectories of surrounding vehicles to safely and effectively plan and drive along trajectories in complex traffic situations. However, predicting the future behavior of vehicles is a challenging issue because traffic vehicles each have different drivers with different driving tendencies and intentions and they interact with each other. This paper presents a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) encoder-decoder model that utilizes an attention mechanism that focuses on certain information to predict vehicles' trajectories. The proposed model was trained using the Highway Drone (HighD) dataset, which is a high-precision, large-scale traffic dataset. We also compared this model to previous studies. Our model effectively predicted future trajectories by using an attention mechanism to manage the importance of the driving flow of the target and adjacent vehicles and the target vehicle's dynamics in each driving situation. Furthermore, this study presents a method of linearizing the road geometry such that the trajectory prediction model can be used in a variety of road environments. We verified that the road geometry linearization mechanism can improve the trajectory prediction model's performance on various road environments in a virtual test-driving simulator constructed based on actual road data.

AB  - <AbstractText Label="BACKGROUND" NlmCategory="BACKGROUND">Approximately 1 in 5 patients feel unsatisfied after total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Prognostic tools may aid in the patient selection process and reduce the proportion of patients who experience unsatisfactory surgery. This study uses the prognostic tool SMART Choice (Patient Prognostic Tool for Total Knee Arthroplasty) to predict patient improvement after TKA. The tool aims to be used by the patient without clinician input and does not require clinical data such as X-ray findings or blood results. The objective of this study is to evaluate the SMART Choice tool on patient decision making, particularly willingness for surgery. We hypothesise that the use of the SMART Choice tool will influence willingness to undergo surgery, especially when used earlier in the patient TKA journey.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="METHODS" NlmCategory="METHODS">This is a multicentred, pragmatic, randomised controlled trial conducted in Melbourne, Australia. Participants will be recruited from the St. Vincent's Hospital, Melbourne (SVHM) Orthopaedic Clinic, and the client base of HCF, Australia (private health insurance company). Patients over 45 years of age who have been diagnosed with knee osteoarthritis and considering TKA are eligible for participation. Participants will be randomised to either use the SMART Choice tool or treatment as usual. The SMART Choice tool provides users with a prediction for improvement or deterioration / no change after surgery based on utility score change calculated from the Veterans-RAND 12 (VR-12) survey. The primary outcome of the study is patient willingness for TKA surgery. The secondary outcomes include evaluating the optimal timing for tool use and using decision quality questionnaires to understand the patient experience when using the tool. Participants will be followed up for 6 months from the time of recruitment.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="DISCUSSION" NlmCategory="CONCLUSIONS">The SMART Choice tool has the potential to improve patient decision making for TKA. Although many prognostic tools have been developed for other areas of surgery, most are confined within academic bodies of work. This study will be one of the first to evaluate the impact of a prognostic tool on patient decision making using a prospective clinical trial, an important step in transitioning the tool for use in clinical practice.</AbstractText>

AB  - Because of the uncertainty of weather and the complexity of atmospheric movement, extreme weather has always been an important and difficult meteorological problem. Extreme weather events can be called high-impact weather, the ‘extreme’ here means that the probability of occurrence is very small. Deep learning can automatically learn and train from a large number of sample data to obtain excellent feature expression, which effectively improves the performance of various machine learning tasks and is widely used in computer vision, natural language processing, and other fields. Based on the introduction of deep learning, this article makes a preliminary summary of the existing extreme weather prediction methods. These include the ability to use recurrent neural networks to predict weather phenomena and convolutional neural networks to predict the weather. They can automatically extract image features of extreme weather phenomena and predict the possibility of extreme weather somewhere by using a deep learning framework.

AB  - Circular cone-beam (CCB) Computed Tomography (CT) has become an integral part of industrial quality control, materials science and medical imaging. The need to acquire and process each scan in a short time naturally leads to trade-offs between speed and reconstruction quality, creating a need for fast reconstruction algorithms capable of creating accurate reconstructions from limited data. In this paper, we introduce the Neural Network Feldkamp–Davis–Kress (NN-FDK) algorithm. This algorithm adds a machine learning component to the FDK algorithm to improve its reconstruction accuracy while maintaining its computational efficiency. Moreover, the NN-FDK algorithm is designed such that it has low training data requirements and is fast to train. This ensures that the proposed algorithm can be used to improve image quality in high-throughput CT scanning settings, where FDK is currently used to keep pace with the acquisition speed using readily available computational resources. We compare the NN-FDK algorithm to two standard CT reconstruction algorithms and to two popular deep neural networks trained to remove reconstruction artifacts from the 2D slices of an FDK reconstruction. We show that the NN-FDK reconstruction algorithm is substantially faster in computing a reconstruction than all the tested alternative methods except for the standard FDK algorithm and we show it can compute accurate CCB CT reconstructions in cases of high noise, a low number of projection angles or large cone angles. Moreover, we show that the training time of an NN-FDK network is orders of magnitude lower than the considered deep neural networks, with only a slight reduction in reconstruction accuracy.

AB  - <jats:p>Movements in the volatility index of the Indian economy are influenced by global volatility indices (fear index). This study evaluates the influence of various global implied volatility indices in forecasting the day-to-day binary movements in the implied volatility index of India, denoted by the symbol ‘India VIX’. Historical daily data from 18 September, 2009, to 2 December, 2021, was acquired, and the target labels were created from changes in the India VIX. A set of classifiers, consisting of Logistic Regression, Random Forest and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XG Boost), were applied to rank the feature variables according to their importance. This study revealed that India’s VIX was impacted most by the previous day’s changes in the closing value of the US implied volatility indices, except for the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) Eurocurrency volatility index. Additionally, the Eurozone implied volatility index was also important. However, the implied volatility indices of Australian Hang Seng and Japan were the least important. This study’s outcomes help Indian traders in creating a watch list of important volatility indices.</jats:p>

AB  - The research area of recommender systems (RS) in e-commerce has become extremely popular in recent years. However, traditional RSs tend to recommend popular items, while niche (long-tail) items are often neglected, which is known as the long-tail problem. However, recent studies found that tail items are one of the key success factors in the e-commerce world. The availability of such items encompasses relatively high marginal profits and boosts the sales of popular short-head items. We suggest promoting long-tail items by leveraging the short-head items' advantages and exposing the user to a tail item that may have not been considered otherwise. We use a classification model and statistical tools to generate personalized recommendations of a long-tail item considering a short-head item that has already been clicked. The uniqueness of our method lies in the combination of tail and head items to uplift the exposure of the latter and in using an applicable solution to deal with the extreme volume of tail items. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on real-world data from eBay and provide an analysis of the long-tail phenomenon and consumption behavior.

AB  - This paper presents a two-stage Machine Learning (ML) model to predict the arrival time of In-Process Control (IPC) samples at the quality testing laboratories of a chemical company. The model was developed using three iterations of the CRoss-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM) methodology, each focusing on a different regression approach. To reduce the ML analyst effort, an Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) was adopted during the modeling stage of CRISP-DM. The AutoML was set to select the best among six distinct state-of-the-art regression algorithms. Using recent real-world data, the three main regression approaches were compared, showing that the proposed two-stage ML model is competitive and provides interesting predictions to support the laboratory management decisions (e.g., preparation of testing instruments). In particular, the proposed method can accurately predict 70% of the examples under a tolerance of 4 time units.

AB  - Background and aims: Obesity is on the rise globally, and is a leading risk factor for T2D. However, it is very heterogeneous, with varying degrees of T2D risk within the same levels of BMI. Better classification may lead to improve outcomes of current preventive and therapeutic strategies. Moreover, by elucidating the mechanisms uncoupling obesity from T2D risk, new possible therapeutic targets may emerge. Leveraging the vast amount of genetic data produced to date may contribute to reach these goals while overcoming the obstacles imposed by common assumptions, biases and confounders present in observational studies. Our aim is to compare the phenome-wide association patterns of BMI-increasing genetic profiles that either concordantly increase or discordantly decrease T2D risk. Materials and methods: Highly concordant and highly discordant SNPs between BMI and T2D were obtained from the latest GWAS for both conditions. Their standardized effect sizes (SES) across multiple traits in the phenome, metabolome, proteinome and transcriptome were retrieved from the online genomic repositories. After alignment to the BMI-increasing allele, these effects were organized into a SNP x Trait matrix. A hierarchical clustering technique, combining PCA and Random Forest algorithms was applied, retrieving the optimal number of clusters of traits, organized in order of importance, useful to distinguish a discordant from a concordant SNP. Posterior probabilities of colocalization with T2D were calculated for each gene using transcriptome results. Tissue, biological process, molecular mechanism and cellular component enrichments were evaluated. The predictive potential of GRSs informed by these findings were assessed in the UK Biobank dataset. Results: 121 SNPs were found to be significantly associated with BMI and T2D. 18 were discordant and 104 concordant. A total of 1372 variables were included in the analyses (Phenome = 546, Metabolome = 233, Proteinome = 593). The most important difference between discordant and concordant SNPs in the phenome matrix was found in a cluster of traits led by hypertension (Mean discordant SES = -1.59, Mean concordant SES = 2.56), highly correlated with two clusters led by coronary heart disease and overall health status, respectively. The second most important cluster was led by physical activity-adjusted WHR (Mean discordant SES = -2.69, Mean concordant SES = 0.24). The model obtained from the phenome matrix had the highest classification performance (Matthews Correlation Coefficient, MCC = 0.79). Metabolome results showed differences in polyunsaturated fatty acids and lipid contents in VLDL, but with lower performance (MCC = 0.67). The model from the proteinome matrix was unable to correctly classify SNPs (MCC = -0.03). Two genes (CCDC92 and DNAH10) showed the strongest association within the discordant set in adipose tissue, both involved in cilia formation. A GRS of these 121 SNPs with weights derived from the clusters with high classification performance was highly associated with T2D in both the general and obese populations in UK Biobank (p < 1x1016). Conclusion: The main difference between BMI-increasing genetic profiles that either discordantly decrease or concordantly increase T2D risk is found in hypertension risk and physical activity-adjusted WHR. These traits can be used to inform GRSs to better classify T2D risk in obesity. Molecular mechanisms behind the discordant profile appear to involve cilia formation in the adipose tissue. (Less)

AB  - The Internet of Things (IoT)-centric concepts like augmented reality, high-resolution video streaming, self-driven cars, smart environment, e-health care, etc. have a ubiquitous presence now. These applications require higher data-rates, large bandwidth, increased capacity, low latency and high throughput. In light of these emerging concepts, IoT has revolutionized the world by providing seamless connectivity between heterogeneous networks (HetNets). The eventual aim of IoT is to introduce the plug and play technology providing the end-user, ease of operation, remotely access control and configurability. This paper presents the IoT technology from a bird’s eye view covering its statistical/architectural trends, use cases, challenges and future prospects. The paper also presents a detailed and extensive overview of the emerging 5G-IoT scenario. Fifth Generation (5G) cellular networks provide key enabling technologies for ubiquitous deployment of the IoT technology. These include carrier aggregation, multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO), massive-MIMO (M-MIMO), coordinated multipoint processing (CoMP), device-to-device (D2D) communications, centralized radio access network (CRAN), software-defined wireless sensor networking (SD-WSN), network function virtualization (NFV) and cognitive radios (CRs). This paper presents an exhaustive review for these key enabling technologies and also discusses the new emerging use cases of 5G-IoT driven by the advances in artificial intelligence, machine and deep learning, ongoing 5G initiatives, quality of service (QoS) requirements in 5G and its standardization issues. Finally, the paper discusses challenges in the implementation of 5G-IoT due to high data-rates requiring both cloud-based platforms and IoT devices based edge computing.

AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Complex interactions between two opposing agents frequently occur in domains of machine learning, game theory, and other application domains. Quantitatively analyzing the strategies involved can provide an objective basis for decision-making. One such critical scenario is shot-taking in football, where decisions, such as whether the attacker should shoot or pass the ball and whether the defender should attempt to block the shot, play a crucial role in the outcome of the game. However, there are currently no effective data-driven and/or theory-based approaches to analyzing such situations. To address this issue, we proposed a novel Shooting Payoff Computation (SPC) framework to analyze such scenarios based on game theory, where we estimate the expected payoff with machine learning (ML) models, and additional features for ML models were extracted with a theory-based shot block model. Conventionally, successes or failures (1 or 0) are used as payoffs, while a success shot (goal) is extremely rare in football. Therefore, we proposed the Expected Probability of Shot On Target (xSOT) metric to evaluate players’ actions even if the shot results in no goal; this allows for effective differentiation and comparison between different shots and even enables counterfactual shot situation analysis. In our experiments, we have validated the SPC framework by comparing it with baseline and ablated models. Furthermore, we have observed a high correlation between the xSOT and existing metrics. This alignment of information suggests that xSOT provides valuable insights. Lastly, as an illustration, we studied optimal strategies in the World Cup 2022 and analyzed a shot situation in EURO 2020.</jats:p>

AB  - In many team sports, the ability to control and generate space in dangerous areas on the pitch is crucial for the success of a team. This holds, in particular, for soccer. In this study, we revisit ideas from Fernandez and Bornn (2018) who introduced interesting space-related quantities including pitch control (PC) and pitch value. We identify influence of the player on the pitch with the movements of the player and turn their concepts into data-driven quantities that give rise to a variety of different applications. Furthermore, we devise a novel space generation measure to visualize the strategies of the team and player. We provide empirical evidence for the usefulness of our contribution and showcase our approach in the context of game analyses.

               <jats:p>The Fermi fourth catalog of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) data release 3 (4LAC-DR3) contains 3407 AGNs, out of which 755 are flat spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs), 1379 are BL Lacertae objects (BL Lac objects), 1208 are blazars of unknown (BCUs) type, while 65 are non-AGNs. Accurate categorization of many unassociated blazars still remains a challenge due to the lack of sufficient optical spectral information. The aim of this work is to use high-precision, optimized machine-learning (ML) algorithms to classify BCUs into BL Lac objects and FSRQs. To address this, we selected the 4LAC-DR3 Clean sample (i.e., sources with no analysis flags) containing 1115 BCUs. We employ five different supervised ML algorithms, namely, random forest, logistic regression, XGBoost, CatBoost, and neural network with seven features: photon index, synchrotron-peak frequency, pivot energy, photon index at pivot energy, fractional variability, <jats:italic>ν</jats:italic>
                  <jats:italic>F</jats:italic>
                  <jats:italic>ν</jats:italic>, at synchrotron-peak frequency, and variability index. Combining results from all models leads to better accuracy and more robust predictions. These five methods together classified 610 BCUs as BL Lac objects and 333 BCUs as FSRQs with a classification metric area under the curve &gt;0.96. Our results are significantly compatible with recent studies as well. The output from this study provides a larger blazar sample with many new targets that could be used for forthcoming multiwavelength surveys. This work can be further extended by adding features in X-rays, UV, visible, and radio wavelengths.</jats:p>

AB  - Technological advances have enabled us to profile multiple molecular layers at unprecedented single-cell resolution and the available datasets from multiple samples or domains are growing. These datasets, including scRNA-seq data, scATAC-seq data and sc-methylation data, usually have different powers in identifying the unknown cell types through clustering. So, methods that integrate multiple datasets can potentially lead to a better clustering performance. Here we propose coupleCoC+ for the integrative analysis of single-cell genomic data. coupleCoC+ is a transfer learning method based on the information-theoretic co-clustering framework. In coupleCoC+, we utilize the information in one dataset, the source data, to facilitate the analysis of another dataset, the target data. coupleCoC+ uses the linked features in the two datasets for effective knowledge transfer, and it also uses the information of the features in the target data that are unlinked with the source data. In addition, coupleCoC+ matches similar cell types across the source data and the target data. By applying coupleCoC+ to the integrative clustering of mouse cortex scATAC-seq data and scRNA-seq data, mouse and human scRNA-seq data, mouse cortex sc-methylation and scRNA-seq data, and human blood dendritic cells scRNA-seq data from two batches, we demonstrate that coupleCoC+ improves the overall clustering performance and matches the cell subpopulations across multimodal single-cell genomic datasets. coupleCoC+ has fast convergence and it is computationally efficient. The software is available at https://github.com/cuhklinlab/coupleCoC_plus.

AB  - <jats:p>The prosperity of mobile and financial technologies has bred and expanded various kinds of financial products to a broader scope of people, which contributes to financial inclusion. It brings non-trivial social benefits of diminishing financial inequality. However, the technical challenges in individual financial risk evaluation exacerbated by the unforeseen user characteristic distribution and limited credit history of new users, as well as the inexperience of newly-entered companies in handling complex data and obtaining accurate labels, impede further promotion of financial inclusion. To tackle these challenges, this paper develops a novel transfer learning algorithm (i.e., TransBoost) that combines the merits of tree-based models and kernel methods. The TransBoost is designed with a parallel tree structure and
 efficient weights updating mechanism with theoretical guarantee, which enables it to excel in tackling real-world data with high dimensional features and sparsity in O(n) time complexity. We conduct extensive experiments on two public datasets and a unique largescale dataset from Tencent Mobile Payment. The results show that the TransBoost outperforms other state-of-the-
 art benchmark transfer learning algorithms in terms of prediction accuracy with superior efficiency, demonstrate stronger robustness to data sparsity, and provide meaningful model interpretation. Besides, given a financial risk level, the TransBoost enables financial service providers to serve the largest number of users including those who would otherwise be excluded by other algorithms. That is, the TransBoost improves financial inclusion.</jats:p>

Existing planning methods such as A* and Hybrid A* are widely used in path planning tasks because of their ability to determine feasible paths even in complex environments; however, they have limitations in terms of efficiency. To overcome these limitations, a path planning algorithm based on a neural network, namely the neural Hybrid A*, is introduced. This paper proposes using a conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE) to guide the search algorithm by exploiting the ability of CVAE to learn information about the planning space given the information of the parking environment. An efficient expansion strategy is utilized based on a distribution of feasible trajectories learned in the demonstrations. The proposed method effectively learns the representations of a given state, and shows improvement in terms of computational time and the number of node expanded related to algorithm performance.

AB  - Exposure to online drinking on social media is associated with real-life alcohol consumption. Building on the Theory of planned behavior, the current study substantially adds to this line of research by identifying the predictors of sharing drunk references on social media. Based on a cross-sectional survey among 1639 adolescents with a mean age of 15 (59% female), this study compares and discusses multiple regression tree algorithms predicting the sharing of drunk references. More specifically, this paper compares the accuracy of classification and regression tree, bagging, random forest and extreme gradient boosting algorithms. The analysis indicates that four concepts are central to predicting adolescents’ sharing of drunk references: (1) exposure to them on social media; (2) the perceived injunctive norms of the mother towards alcohol consumption; (3) the perceived descriptive norms of best friends towards alcohol consumption; and (4) willingness to drink alcohol. The most accurate results were obtained using extreme gradient boosting. This study provides theoretical, practical, and methodological conclusions. It shows that maternal norms toward alcohol consumption are a central predictor for sharing drunk references. Therefore, future media literacy interventions should take an ecological perspective. In addition, this analysis indicates that regression trees are an advantageous method in youth research, combining accurate predictions with straightforward interpretations.

AB  - <jats:p>Manufacturing processes need optimization. Three-dimensional (3D) printing is not an exception. Consequently, 3D printing process parameters must be accurately calibrated to fabricate objects with desired properties irrespective of their field of application. One of the desired properties of a 3D printed object is its tensile strength. Without predictive models, optimizing the 3D printing process for achieving the desired tensile strength can be a tedious and expensive exercise. This study compares the effectiveness of the following five predictive models (i.e., machine learning algorithms) used to estimate the tensile strength of 3D printed objects: (1) linear regression, (2) random forest regression, (3) AdaBoost regression, (4) gradient boosting regression, and (5) XGBoost regression. First, all the machine learning models are tuned for optimal hyperparameters, which control the learning process of the algorithms. Then, the results from each machine learning model are compared using several statistical metrics such as 𝑅2, mean squared error (MSE), mean absolute error (MAE), maximum error, and median error. The XGBoost regression model is the most effective among the tested algorithms. It is observed that the five tested algorithms can be ranked as XG boost &gt; gradient boost &gt; AdaBoost &gt; random forest &gt; linear regression.</jats:p>

AB  - A new scoring system based on information technology (IT) is an innovative way to judge matches fairly. However, there are reliability and expertise problems due to sophisticated differences in human-machine judging criteria. Taekwondo, a traditional Korean sport, uses an IT-based protector and scoring system. The system records the player's movement data through its sensors, but it has a limitation in that it cannot detect anomalous kicks. Because anomalous kicks are executed with minimal strength outside the typical form of kick patterns, it interrupts fair judgment of the scoring system and reduces the liveliness of Taekwondo matches. To minimize the dispute by anomalous kicks, we aim to detect the anomalous kicks in Taekwondo matches. We construct a kick dataset and propose an attention-based deep learning model. The proposed model has the advantage of simultaneously handling the spatial and temporal features of the kick dataset because it is a model that combines a convolutional neural network (CNN) and bidirectional long-short term memory (BiLSTM) with an attention mechanism. The experimental results showed that the accuracy of the attention-based CNN-BiLSTM is 95.67%, and the false-positive rate is 0.086. We open our dataset and it is freely available on https://github.com/daanVeer/Taekwondo_dataset.

AB  - The preference for simple explanations, known as the parsimony principle, has long guided the development of scientific theories, hypotheses, and models. Yet recent years have seen a number of successes in employing highly complex models for scientific inquiry (e.g., for 3D protein folding or climate forecasting). In this paper, we reexamine the parsimony principle in light of these scientific and technological advancements. We review recent developments, including the surprising benefits of modeling with more parameters than data, the increasing appreciation of the context-sensitivity of data and misspecification of scientific models, and the development of new modeling tools. By integrating these insights, we reassess the utility of parsimony as a proxy for desirable model traits, such as predictive accuracy, interpretability, effectiveness in guiding new research, and resource efficiency. We conclude that more complex models are sometimes essential for scientific progress, and discuss the ways in which parsimony and complexity can play complementary roles in scientific modeling practice.

AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Predicting outcomes in soccer is crucial for various stakeholders, including teams, leagues, bettors, the betting industry, media, and fans. With advancements in computer vision, player tracking data has become abundant, leading to the development of sophisticated soccer analytics models.  However, existing models often rely solely on spatiotemporal features derived from player tracking data, which may not fully capture the complexities of in-game dynamics. In this paper, we present an end-to-end system that leverages raw event and tracking data to predict both offensive and defensive actions, along with the optimal decision for each game scenario, based solely on historical game data. Our model incorporates the effectiveness of these actions to accurately predict win probabilities at every minute of the game. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving an accuracy of 87% in predicting offensive and defensive actions. Furthermore, our in-game outcome prediction model exhibits an error rate of 0.1, outperforming counterpart models and bookmakers’ odds.</jats:p>

AB  - <jats:p>Introduction/purpose: This paper examines some of the applications of Chebyshev's inequality. Using Chebyshev's inequality, the analysis of a preliminary feasibility study for constructing a solar thermal power plant in the Banja Luka area has been conducted. The goal of the preliminary analysis is to show, without financial investments, if there is a basis for the climate parameters measurement in the area. Methods: For the known values of the arithmetic means and the standard deviations of the number of cloudy days, the probability of deviation of the number of cloudy days from the mean value was defined by applying Chebyshev's inequality. Results: The diagram shows the values of the upper and lower limits of the number of cloudy days that deviate from the expected value with a probability of 50%. Conclusion: The preliminary assessment of the justification of the realization of a solar thermal power plant justifies the measurements necessary for the analysis and detailed calculation of this type of a plant, because the annual interval of cloudy days is from 94 to 164, or from 26 to 44% in the year.</jats:p>

AB  - Climate change represents one of the most critical threats to biodiversity with far-reaching consequences for species interactions, the functioning of ecosystems, or the assembly of biotic communities. Plant phenology research has gained increasing attention as the timing of periodic events in plants is strongly affected by seasonal and interannual climate variation. Recent technological development allowed us to gather invaluable data at a variety of spatial and ecological scales. The feasibility of phenological monitoring today and in the future depends heavily on developing tools capable of efficiently analyzing these enormous amounts of data. Deep Neural Networks learn representations from data with impressive accuracy and lead to significant breakthroughs in, e.g., image processing. This article is the first systematic literature review aiming to thoroughly analyze all primary studies on deep learning approaches in plant phenology research. In a multi-stage process, we selected 24 peer-reviewed studies published in the last five years (2016-2021).

AB  - Abstract. Sustainable urban drainage systems (SuDS) are decentralized stormwater management practices that mimic natural drainage processes. The hydrological processes of SuDS are often modeled using process-based models. However, it can require considerable effort to set up these models. This study thus proposes a machine learning (ML) method to directly learn the statistical correlations between the hydrological responses of SuDS and the forcing variables at sub-hourly timescales from
observation data. The proposed methods are applied to two SuDS catchments
with different sizes, SuDS practice types, and data availabilities in the
USA for discharge prediction. The resulting models have high prediction
accuracies (Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency, NSE, >0.70 ). ML explanation methods are then employed to derive the basis of each ML prediction, based on which the hydrological processes being modeled are then inferred. The physical realism of the inferred hydrological processes is then compared to that would be expected based on the domain-specific knowledge of the system being modeled. The inferred processes of some models, however, are found to be physically implausible. For instance, negative contributions of rainfall to runoff have been identified in some models. This study further empirically shows that an ML model's ability to provide accurate predictions can be uncorrelated with its ability to offer plausible explanations to the physical processes being modeled. Finally, this study provides a high-level overview of the practices of inferring physical processes from the ML modeling results and shows both conceptually and empirically that large uncertainty exists in every step of the inference processes. In summary, this study shows that ML methods are a useful tool for predicting the hydrological responses of SuDS catchments, and the hydrological processes inferred from modeling results should be interpreted cautiously due to the existence of large uncertainty in the inference processes.

AB  - We introduce a method to draw causal inferences-inferences immune to all possible confounding-from genetic data that include parents and offspring. Causal conclusions are possible with these data because the natural randomness in meiosis can be viewed as a high-dimensional randomized experiment. We make this observation actionable by developing a conditional independence test that identifies regions of the genome containing distinct causal variants. The proposed digital twin test compares an observed offspring to carefully constructed synthetic offspring from the same parents to determine statistical significance, and it can leverage any black-box multivariate model and additional nontrio genetic data to increase power. Crucially, our inferences are based only on a well-established mathematical model of recombination and make no assumptions about the relationship between the genotypes and phenotypes. We compare our method to the widely used transmission disequilibrium test and demonstrate enhanced power and localization.

AB  - Genetic variations have a multitude of effects on proteins. A substantial number of variations affect protein–solvent interactions, either aggregation or solubility. Aggregation is often related to structural alterations, whereas solubilizable proteins in the solid phase can be made again soluble by dilution. Solubility is a central protein property and when reduced can lead to diseases. We developed a prediction method, PON-Sol2, to identify amino acid substitutions that increase, decrease, or have no effect on the protein solubility. The method is a machine learning tool utilizing gradient boosting algorithm and was trained on a large dataset of variants with different outcomes after the selection of features among a large number of tested properties. The method is fast and has high performance. The normalized correct prediction rate for three states is 0.656, and the normalized GC2 score is 0.312 in 10-fold cross-validation. The corresponding numbers in the blind test were 0.545 and 0.157. The performance was superior in comparison to previous methods. The PON-Sol2 predictor is freely available. It can be used to predict the solubility effects of variants for any organism, even in large-scale projects.

AB  - The complex feature characteristics and low contrast of cancer lesions, a high degree of inter-class resemblance between malignant and benign lesions, and the presence of various artifacts including hairs make automated melanoma recognition in dermoscopy images quite challenging. To date, various computer-aided solutions have been proposed to identify and classify skin cancer. In this paper, a deep learning model with a shallow architecture is proposed to classify the lesions into benign and malignant. To achieve effective training while limiting overfitting problems due to limited training data, image preprocessing and data augmentation processes are introduced. After this, the 'box blur' down-scaling method is employed, which adds efficiency to our study by reducing the overall training time and space complexity significantly. Our proposed shallow convolutional neural network (SCNN_12) model is trained and evaluated on the Kaggle skin cancer data ISIC archive which was augmented to 16485 images by implementing different augmentation techniques. The model was able to achieve an accuracy of 98.87% with optimizer Adam and a learning rate of 0.001. In this regard, parameter and hyper-parameters of the model are determined by performing ablation studies. To assert no occurrence of overfitting, experiments are carried out exploring k-fold cross-validation and different dataset split ratios. Furthermore, to affirm the robustness the model is evaluated on noisy data to examine the performance when the image quality gets corrupted.This research corroborates that effective training for medical image analysis, addressing training time and space complexity, is possible even with a lightweighted network using a limited amount of training data.

AB  - The population of electric vehicles (EVs) has grown rapidly over the past decade due to the development of EV technologies, battery materials, charger facilities, and public charging services. Many governments have implemented plans to ban fossil fuel vehicles considering the significance of EVs in reducing greenhouse gas emissions. However, due to the battery material characteristics and charger power limitations, the EV charging process requires more time than is needed to fill a non-EV with fuel at a gasoline station, causing drivers to experience range anxiety and impeding the promotion of EVs. Hence, the battery swapping station (BSS) model has been proposed as an alternative method. Recently, researchers have studied the BSS approach by proposing various operation systems and optimization methods, and BSS service operators have successfully implemented swapping at commercial and private stations. This paper reviews the state-of-the-art BSS literature and business models, where the BSS offers a recharged battery to an incoming EV with a low state-of-charge. First, four operation modes are presented: a single BSS, multiple BSSs, an integrated BSS and battery charging station (BCS), and multiple BSSs and BCSs. Then, the BSS decision scenarios are surveyed in relation to five operational areas, i.e., charging schedule, service policy, construction and planning, dispatching and routing, and power management, where the scenarios are compared in terms of the BSS mode, decision maker, EV category, number of battery types, vehicle to grid, and focus and objective. Finally, the survey concludes with a discussion of several future research directions for EV BSSs.

AB  - Paclitaxel resistance is associated with a poor prognosis in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients, and currently, there is no promising drug for paclitaxel resistance. In this study, we investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying the chemoresistance in human NSCLC-derived cell lines. We constructed paclitaxel-resistant NSCLC cell lines (A549/PR and H460/PR) by long-term exposure to paclitaxel. We found that triptolide, a diterpenoid epoxide isolated from the Chinese medicinal herb Tripterygium wilfordii Hook F, effectively enhanced the sensitivity of paclitaxel-resistant cells to paclitaxel by reducing ABCB1 expression in vivo and in vitro. Through high-throughput sequencing, we identified the SHH-initiated Hedgehog signaling pathway playing an important role in this process. We demonstrated that triptolide directly bound to HNF1A, one of the transcription factors of SHH, and inhibited HNF1A/SHH expression, ensuing in attenuation of Hedgehog signaling. In NSCLC tumor tissue microarrays and cancer network databases, we found a positive correlation between HNF1A and SHH expression. Our results illuminate a novel molecular mechanism through which triptolide targets and inhibits HNF1A, thereby impeding the activation of the Hedgehog signaling pathway and reducing the expression of ABCB1. This study suggests the potential clinical application of triptolide and provides promising prospects in targeting the HNF1A/SHH pathway as a therapeutic strategy for NSCLC patients with paclitaxel resistance. Schematic diagram showing that triptolide overcomes paclitaxel resistance by mediating inhibition of the HNF1A/SHH/ABCB1 axis.

AB  - Alternative polyadenylation (APA) is a crucial step in post-transcriptional regulation. Previous bioinformatic works have mainly focused on the recognition of polyadenylation sites (PAS) in a given genomic sequence, which is a binary classification problem. Recently, computational methods for predicting the usage level of alternative PAS in a same gene have been proposed. However, all of them cast the problem as a non-quantitative pairwise comparison task and do not take the competition among multiple PAS into account. To address this, here we propose a deep learning architecture, DeeReCT-APA, to quantitatively predict the usage of all alternative PAS of a given gene. To accommodate different genes with potentially different numbers of PAS, DeeReCT-APA treats the problem as a regression task with a variable-length target. Based on a CNN-LSTM architecture, DeeReCT-APA extracts sequence features with CNN layers, uses bidirectional LSTM to explicitly model the interactions among competing PAS, and outputs percentage scores representing the usage levels of all PAS of a gene. In addition to the fact that only our method can predict quantitatively the usage of all the PAS within a gene, we show that our method consistently outperforms other existing methods on three different tasks for which they are trained: pairwise comparison task, highest usage prediction task and ranking task. Finally, we demonstrate that our method can be used to predict the effect of genetic variations on APA patterns and shed light on future mechanistic understanding in APA regulation. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/lzx325/DeeReCT-APA-repo.

AB  - <AbstractText Label="MOTIVATION">Interpretable deep learning (DL) models that can provide biological insights, in addition to accurate predictions, are of great interest to the biomedical community. Recently, interpretable DL models that incorporate signaling pathways have been proposed for drug response prediction (DRP). While these models improve interpretability, it is unclear whether this comes at the cost of less accurate DRPs, or a prediction improvement can also be obtained.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="RESULTS">We comprehensively and systematically assessed four state-of-the-art interpretable DL models using three pathway collections to assess their ability in making accurate predictions on unseen samples from the same dataset, as well as their generalizability to an independent dataset. Our results showed that models that explicitly incorporate pathway information in the form of a latent layer perform worse compared to models that incorporate this information implicitly. However, in most evaluation setups, the best performance was achieved using a black-box multilayer perceptron, and the performance of a random forests baseline was comparable to those of the interpretable models. Replacing the signaling pathways with randomly generated pathways showed a comparable performance for the majority of the models. Finally, the performance of all models deteriorated when applied to an independent dataset. These results highlight the importance of systematic evaluation of newly proposed models using carefully selected baselines. We provide different evaluation setups and baseline models that can be used to achieve this goal.</AbstractText>

AB  - <jats:p>Diabetes mellitus is also called gestational diabetes when a woman has high blood sugar while pregnant. It can show up at any time during pregnancy and cause problems for the mother and baby during or after the pregnancy. If the risks are found and dealt with as soon as possible, there is a chance that they can be reduced. The healthcare system is one of the many parts of our daily lives that are being rethought thanks to the creation of intelligent systems by machine learning algorithms. In this article, a hybrid prediction model is suggested to determine if a woman has gestational diabetes. The recommended model reduces the amount of data using the K-means clustering method. Predictions are made using several classification methods, such as decision trees, random forests, SVM, KNN, logistic regression, and naive Bayes. The results show that accuracy increases when clustering and classification are used together.</jats:p>

AB  - The topic of human activity recognition has gained a lot of attention due to its usage for exercise monitoring, smart health and assisted living. Even though the aforementioned domains have received significant interest by researchers, activity recognition for industrial settings has received little attention in comparison. Industry 4.0 involves the assimilation of industrial workers with robots and other equipment used in the industry and necessitates the development of recognition methodologies for activities being performed in industries. In this regard, this paper presents a comparison in performance of various time/frequency domain features and popular machine learning algorithms for use in activity recognition in a logistics scenario. Experiments were conducted on inertial measurement sensor data from the recently released LARa dataset which involved three feature sets being used with four machine learning algorithms; Support Vector Machines, Decision Trees, Random Forests and Extreme Gradient Boost (XGBoost). The best result achieved in the experiments was an average accuracy of 78.61% using the XGBoost classifier while using both time and frequency domain features. This work serves as a baseline for activity recognition in logistics using IMU sensors and enables the development of solutions to support fulfillment of Industry 4.0 goals.

AB  - N-linked glycosylation is one of the most common protein post-translation modifications (PTMs) in humans where the Asparagine (N) amino acid of the protein is attached to the glycan. It is involved in most biological processes and associated with various human diseases as diabetes, cancer, coronavirus, influenza, and Alzheimer's. Accordingly, identifying N-linked glycosylation sites will be beneficial to understanding the system and mechanism of glycosylation. Due to the experimental challenges of glycosylation site identification, machine learning becomes very important to predict the glycosylation sites. This paper proposes a novel N-linked glycosylation predictor based on bagging positive-unlabeled (PU) learning and stacking ensemble machine learning (PUStackNGly). In the proposed PUStackNGly, comprehensive sequence and structural-based features are extracted using different feature extraction descriptors. Then, ensemble-based feature selection is employed to select the most significant and stable features. The ensemble bagging PU learning selects the reliable negative samples from the unlabeled samples using four supervised learning methods (support vector machines, random forest, logistic regression, and XGBoost). Then, stacking ensemble learning is applied using four base classifiers: logistic regression, artificial neural networks, random forest, and support vector machine. The experiments results show that PUStackNGly has a promising predicting performance compared to supervised learning methods. Furthermore, the proposed PUStackNgly outperforms the existing N-linked glycosylation prediction tools on an independent dataset with 95.11% accuracy, 100% recall 80.7% precision, 89.32% F1 score, 96.93% AUC, and 0.87 MCC.

AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>In recent years, several progressive studies promote the development of aerial tracking. One of the representative studies is our previous work Fast‐Tracker which is applicable to various challenging tracking scenarios. However, it suffers from two main drawbacks: (1) the oversimplification in target detection by using artificial markers and (2) the contradiction between simultaneous target and environment perception with limited onboard vision. In this study, we upgrade the target detection in Fast‐Tracker to detect and localise a human target based on deep learning and non‐linear regression to solve the former problem. For the latter one, we equip the quadrotor system with 360° active vision on a customised gimbal camera. Furthermore, we improve the tracking trajectory planning in Fast‐Tracker by incorporating an occlusion‐aware mechanism that generates observable tracking trajectories. Comprehensive real‐world tests confirm the proposed system's robustness and real‐time capability. Benchmark comparisons with Fast‐Tracker validate that the proposed system presents better tracking performance even when performing more difficult tracking tasks.

AB  - The ability to perform de novo protein design will allow researchers to expand the variety of available proteins. By designing synthetic structures computationally, they can utilise more structures than those available in the Protein Data Bank, design structures that are not found in nature, or direct the design of proteins to acquire a specific desired structure. While some researchers attempt to design proteins from first physical and thermodynamic principals, we decided to attempt to test whether it is possible to perform de novo helical protein design ofjust the backbone statistically using machine learning by building a model that uses a long short-term memory (LSTM) generative adversarial network (GAN) architecture. The LSTM-based GAN model used only theφandψangles of each residue from an augmented dataset of only helical protein structures. Though the network’s generated backbone structures were not perfect, they were idealised and evaluated post generation where the non-ideal structures were filtered out and the adequate structures kept. The results were successful in developing a logical, rigid, compact,helical protein backbone topology. This paper is a proof of concept that shows it is possible to generate a novel helical backbone topology using an LSTM-GAN architecture using only theφandψangles as features. The next step is to attempt to use these backbone topologies and sequence design them to form complete protein structures.

AB  - Electroencephalography is the recording of brain electrical activities that can be used to diagnose brain seizure disorders. By identifying brain activity patterns and their correspondence between symptoms and diseases, it is possible to give an accurate diagnosis and appropriate drug therapy to patients. This work aims to categorize electroencephalography signals on different channels' recordings for classifying and predicting epileptic seizures. The collection of the electroencephalography recordings contained in the dataset attributes 179 information and 11,500 instances. Instances are of five categories, where one is the symptoms of epilepsy seizure. We have used traditional, ensemble methods and deep machine learning techniques highlighting their performance for the epilepsy seizure detection task. One dimensional convolutional neural network, ensemble machine learning techniques like bagging, boosting (AdaBoost, gradient boosting, and XG boosting), and stacking is implemented. Traditional machine learning techniques such as decision tree, random forest, extra tree, ridge classifier, logistic regression, K-Nearest Neighbor, Naive Bayes (gaussian), and Kernel Support Vector Machine (polynomial, gaussian) are used for classifying and predicting epilepsy seizure. Before using ensemble and traditional techniques, we have preprocessed the data set using the Karl Pearson coefficient of correlation to eliminate irrelevant attributes. Further accuracy of classification and prediction of the classifiers are manipulated using k-fold cross-validation methods and represent the Receiver Operating Characteristic Area Under the Curve for each classifier. After sorting and comparing algorithms, we have found the convolutional neural network and extra tree bagging classifiers to have better performance than all other ensemble and traditional classifiers.

AB  - Heterogeneous architectures and heterogeneous-ISA designs are growing areas of computer architecture and system software research. Unfortunately, this line of research is significantly hindered by the lack of experimental systems and modifiable hardware frameworks. This work proposes BYOC, a "Bring Your Own Core" framework that is specifically designed to enable heterogeneous-ISA and heterogeneous system research. BYOC is an open-source hardware framework that provides a scalable cache coherence system, that includes out-of-the-box support for four different ISAs (RISC-V 32-bit, RISC-V 64-bit, x86, and SPARCv9) and has been connected to ten different cores. The framework also supports multiple loosely coupled accelerators and is a fully working system supporting SMP Linux. The Transaction-Response Interface (TRI) introduced with BYOC has been specifically designed to make it easy to add in new cores with new ISAs and memory interfaces. This work demonstrates multiple multi-ISA designs running on FPGA and characterises the communication costs. This work describes many of the architectural design trade-offs for building such a flexible system. BYOC is well suited to be the premiere platform for heterogeneous-ISA architecture, system software, and compiler research.

AB  - A classification scheme for the etiology of brain disease based on magnetic resonance imaging is proposed in this paper. Then, attention-based, transfer learning (Extracting variable characteristics of patterns from MRI scans) was used to generate more accurate predictive patterns, and finally, features were trained and used to classify fMRI data to Boost derived hyper-parameters were obtained and evaluated to identify different patterns of dementia risk. Typically-to-to-independent variable extractions are performed by using gradient boosting and then produces derived variables. The MRI in the system is pulled from the ADNI database. When using Feature extractor's technique, we find that most features are extracted at an acceptable speeds. The experimental results proved that the proposed approach can be applied to the task of classifying output in the proper manner. The method would help to increase precision and accuracy by (almost) 4.2 percent, while keeping recall at (virtually) 94.6%

AB  - Cytokines are critical for intercellular communication in human health and disease, but the investigation of cytokine signaling activity has remained challenging due to the short half-lives of cytokines and the complexity/redundancy of cytokine functions. To address these challenges, we developed the Cytokine Signaling Analyzer (CytoSig; https://cytosig.ccr.cancer.gov/ ), providing both a database of target genes modulated by cytokines and a predictive model of cytokine signaling cascades from transcriptomic profiles. We collected 20,591 transcriptome profiles for human cytokine, chemokine and growth factor responses. This atlas of transcriptional patterns induced by cytokines enabled the reliable prediction of signaling activities in distinct cell populations in infectious diseases, chronic inflammation and cancer using bulk and single-cell transcriptomic data. CytoSig revealed previously unidentified roles of many cytokines, such as BMP6 as an anti-inflammatory factor, and identified candidate therapeutic targets in human inflammatory diseases, such as CXCL8 for severe coronavirus disease 2019.

AB  - The recently introduced real-valued gene-pool optimal mixing evolutionary algorthm (RV-GOMEA) has been shown to be among the state of the art for solving gray-box optimization problems where partial evaluations can be leveraged. A core strength is its ability to effectively exploit the linkage structure of a problem, which often is unknown a priori and has to be learned online. Previously published work on RV-GOMEA, however, demonstrated excellent scalability when the linkage structure is prespecified appropriately. A mutual information-based metric to learn linkage structure online, as commonly adopted in EDA’s and the original discrete version of the gene-pool optimal mixing evolutionary algorithm, did not lead to similarly excellent results, especially in a black-box setting. In this article, the strengths of RV-GOMEA are combined with a new fitness-based linkage learning approach that is inspired by differential grouping that reduces its computational overhead by an order of magnitude for problems with fewer interactions. The resulting new version of RV-GOMEA achieves scalability similar to when a predefined linkage model is used, outperforming also, for the first time, the EDA AMaLGaM upon which it is partially based in a black-box setting where partial evaluations cannot be leveraged. 1 1 This article is extended from the MSc thesis of Chantal Olieman, available at https://repository.tudelft.nl/ [24] .

It has a transformative effect on integrating technology into people’s daily lives. IoT covers essential areas such as smart cities, smart homes, and health-based industries. However, security and privacy challenges arise with the rapid growth of IoT devices and applications. Vulnerabilities such as node spoofing, unauthorized access to data, and cyberattacks such as denial of service (DoS), eavesdropping, and intrusion detection have emerged as significant concerns. Recently, machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) methods have significantly progressed and are robust solutions to address these security issues in IoT devices. This paper comprehensively reviews IoT security research focusing on ML/DL approaches. It also categorizes recent studies on security issues based on ML/DL solutions and highlights their opportunities, advantages, and limitations.

AB  - Gaussian states have played an important role in the physics of continuous-variable quantum systems. They are appealing for the experimental ease with which they can be produced, and for their compact and elegant mathematical description. Nevertheless, many proposed quantum technologies require us to go beyond the realm of Gaussian states and introduce non-Gaussian elements. In this Tutorial, we provide a roadmap for the physics of non-Gaussian quantum states. We introduce the phase-space representations as a framework to describe the different properties of quantum states in continuous-variable systems. We then use this framework in various ways to explore the structure of the state space. We explain how non-Gaussian states can be characterized not only through the negative values of their Wigner function, but also via other properties such as quantum non-Gaussianity and the related stellar rank. For multimode systems, we are naturally confronted with the question of how non-Gaussian properties behave with respect to quantum correlations. To answer this question, we first show how non-Gaussian states can be created by performing measurements on a subset of modes in a Gaussian state. Then, we highlight that these measured modes must be correlated via specific quantum correlations to the remainder of the system to create quantum non-Gaussian or Wigner-negative states. On the other hand, non-Gaussian operations are also shown to enhance or even create quantum correlations. Finally, we demonstrate that Wigner negativity is a requirement to violate Bell inequalities and to achieve a quantum computational advantage. At the end of the Tutorial, we also provide an overview of several experimental realizations of non-Gaussian quantum states in quantum optics and beyond.

AB  - This tutorial paper examines recent advances in data engineering, focusing on aspects of network management and orchestration. We provide a comprehensive analysis of standardization efforts as well as platform development activities related to data engineering driven network design. We then focus on the integration aspects of the data engineering ecosystem and telecommunication networks. The results of our tutorial investigation show that despite various efforts towards standardization and network management and orchestration platforms, there is still a significant gap in applying recent developments in the evolving data engineering world to the telecommunication domain. New advanced functionalities in data engineering as well as clear separations between the building blocks of data engineering pipelines within the proposed standardized architectures have been overlooked or not explored in detail by the standardization or platform development bodies in the telecommunication domain. Therefore, at the end of the paper, we discuss these gaps and research challenges in the context of future development processes for data engineering-driven network design and applications of data engineering concepts in telecommunication networks. We also propose several recommendations for early adoption of these technologies and frameworks in telecommunication infrastructures and platforms.

AB  - There is a limited understanding of the pathophysiology of postacute pulmonary sequelae in severe COVID-19. The aim of current study was to define the circulating microRNA (miRNA) profiles associated with pulmonary function and radiologic features in survivors of SARS-CoV-2-induced ARDS. The study included patients who developed ARDS secondary to SARS-CoV-2 infection (n = 167) and a group of infected patients who did not develop ARDS (n = 33). Patients were evaluated 3 months after hospital discharge. The follow-up included a complete pulmonary evaluation and chest computed tomography. Plasma miRNA profiling was performed using RT-qPCR. Random forest was used to construct miRNA signatures associated with lung diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (D<sub>LCO</sub>) and total severity score (TSS). Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analyses were conducted. D<sub>LCO </sub>< 80% predicted was observed in 81.8% of the patients. TSS showed a median [P<sub>25</sub>;P<sub>75</sub>] of 5 [2;8]. The miRNA model associated with D<sub>LCO</sub> comprised miR-17-5p, miR-27a-3p, miR-126-3p, miR-146a-5p and miR-495-3p. Concerning radiologic features, a miRNA signature composed by miR-9-5p, miR-21-5p, miR-24-3p and miR-221-3p correlated with TSS values. These associations were not observed in the non-ARDS group. KEGG pathway and GO enrichment analyses provided evidence of molecular mechanisms related not only to profibrotic or anti-inflammatory states but also to cell death, immune response, hypoxia, vascularization, coagulation and viral infection. In conclusion, diffusing capacity and radiological features in survivors from SARS-CoV-2-induced ARDS are associated with specific miRNA profiles. These findings provide novel insights into the possible molecular pathways underlying the pathogenesis of pulmonary sequelae.<b>Trial registration:</b> ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT04457505..<b>Trial registration:</b> ISRCTN.org identifier: ISRCTN16865246..

AB  - Educational Data Mining plays a critical role in advancing the learning environment by contributing state-of-the-art methods, techniques, and applications. The recent development provides valuable tools for understanding the student learning environment by exploring and utilizing educational data using machine learning and data mining techniques. Modern academic institutions operate in a highly competitive and complex environment. Analyzing performance, providing high-quality education, strategies for evaluating the students’ performance, and future actions are among the prevailing challenges universities face. Student intervention plans must be implemented in these universities to overcome problems experienced by the students during their studies. In this systematic review, the relevant EDM literature related to identifying student dropouts and students at risk from 2009 to 2021 is reviewed. The review results indicated that various Machine Learning (ML) techniques are used to understand and overcome the underlying challenges; predicting students at risk and students drop out prediction. Moreover, most studies use two types of datasets: data from student colleges/university databases and online learning platforms. ML methods were confirmed to play essential roles in predicting students at risk and dropout rates, thus improving the students’ performance.

AB  - Purpose Due to the excessive use of raw materials in diagnostic tools and equipment during the COVID-19 pandemic, there is a dire need for cheaper and more effective methods in the healthcare system. With the development of artificial intelligence (AI) methods in medical sciences as low-cost and safer diagnostic methods, researchers have turned their attention to the use of imaging tools with AI that have fewer complications for patients and reduce the consumption of healthcare resources. Despite its limitations, X-ray is suggested as the first-line diagnostic modality for detecting and screening COVID-19 cases. Method This systematic review assessed the current state of AI applications and the performance of algorithms in X-ray image analysis. The search strategy yielded 322 results from four databases and google scholar, 60 of which met the inclusion criteria. The performance statistics included the area under the receiver operating characteristics (AUC) curve, accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. Result The average sensitivity and specificity of CXR equipped with AI algorithms for COVID-19 diagnosis were >96% (83%-100%) and 92% (80%-100%), respectively. For common X-ray methods in COVID-19 detection, these values were 0.56 (95% CI 0.51-0.60) and 0.60 (95% CI 0.54-0.65), respectively. AI has substantially improved the diagnostic performance of X-rays in COVID-19. Conclusion X-rays equipped with AI can serve as a tool to screen the cases requiring CT scans. The use of this tool does not waste time or impose extra costs, has minimal complications, and can thus decrease or remove unnecessary CT slices and other healthcare resources.

AB  - With the introduction of the Internet to the mainstream like e-commerce, online banking, health system and other day-to-day essentials, risk of being exposed to various are increasing exponentially. Zero-day attack(s) targeting unknown vulnerabilities of a software or system opens up further research direction in the field of cyber-attacks. Existing approaches either uses ML/DNN or anomaly-based approach to protect against these attacks. Detecting zero-day attacks through these techniques miss several parameters like frequency of particular byte streams in network traffic and their correlation. Covering attacks that produce lower traffic is difficult through neural network models because it requires higher traffic for correct prediction. This paper proposes a novel robust and intelligent cyber-attack detection model to cover the issues mentioned above using the concept of heavy-hitter and graph technique to detect zero-day attacks. The proposed work consists of two phases (a) Signature generation and (b) Evaluation phase. This model evaluates the performance using generated signatures at the training phase. The result analysis of the proposed zero-day attack detection shows higher performance for accuracy of 91.33% for the binary classification and accuracy of 90.35% for multi-class classification on real-time attack data. The performance against benchmark data set CICIDS18 shows a promising result of 91.62% for binary-class classification on this model. Thus, the proposed approach shows an encouraging result to detect zero-day attacks.

AB  - Rural and urban America have becoming increasingly divided, both politically and economically. Entrepreneurship can help rural communities catch back up by jumpstarting economic growth, creating jobs, and building resilience to economic shocks. However, less is known about firm creation in rural areas compared to urban areas. To that end, in this paper we ask: What factors predict firm creation in rural America? Our analysis, based on a comparative framework involving multiple machine learning modeling techniques, helps addresses three gaps in academic literature on rural firm creation. First, entrepreneurship research stretches across disciplines, often using econometric methods to identify the effect of a specific variable, rather than comparing the predictive importance of multiple variables. Second, research on firm creation centers on high-tech, urban firms. Third, modern machine learning techniques have not yet been applied in an integrated way to address rural entrepreneurship, a complex economic and policy problem that defies simple, monocausal claims. In this paper, we apply four machine learning methods (subset selection, lasso, random forest, and extreme gradient boosting) to a novel dataset to examine what social and economic factors are predictive of firm growth in rural Texas counties from 2008-2018. Our results suggest that some factors commonly discussed as promoting entrepreneurship (e.g., access to broadband and patents) may not be as predictive as socioeconomic ones (age distribution, ethnic diversity, social capital, and immigration). We also find that the strength of specific industries (oil, wind, healthcare, and elder/childcare) predicts firm growth, as does the number of local banks. Most factors predictive of firm growth in rural counties are distinct from those in urban counties, supporting the argument that rural entrepreneurship is a distinct phenomenon worthy of distinct focus. More broadly, this multi-model approach can offer initial, focusing guidance to policymakers seeking to address similarly complex policy problems.

AB  - We apply a machine learning algorithm called XGBoost to explore the periodicity of two radio sources: PKS~1921-293 (OV~236) and PKS~2200+420 (BL~Lac), both radio frequency dataset obtained from University of Michigan Radio Astronomy Observatory (UMRAO), at 4.8 GHz, 8.0 GHz, and 14.5 GHz, between 1969 to 2012. From this methods, we find that the XGBoost provides the opportunity to use a machine learning based methodology on radio dataset and to extract information with strategies quite different from those traditionally used to treat time series and to obtain periodicity through the classification of recurrent events. The results were compared with other methods from others works that examined the same dataset and exhibit good agreement with them.

AB  - We develop a factorization framework to compute the double differential cross section in soft drop groomed jet mass and groomed jet radius. We describe the effective theories in the large, intermediate, and small groomed jet radius regions defined by the interplay of the jet mass and the groomed jet radius measurement. As an application we present the NLL$'$ results for the perturbative moments that are related to the coefficients $C_1$ and $C_2$ that specify the leading hadronization corrections up to three universal parameters. We compare our results with Monte Carlo simulations and a calculation using the coherent branching method.

AB  - In the global epidemic era, oral problems significantly impact a major population of children. The key to a child's optimal health is early diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of these disorders. In recent years, the field of artificial intelligence (AI) has seen tremendous pace and progress. As a result, AI's infiltration is witnessed even in those areas that were traditionally thought to be best left to human specialists. The ultimate ability to improve patient care and make precise diagnoses of illnesses has revolutionized the world of healthcare. In the field of dentistry, the competence to execute treatment measures while still providing appropriate patient behavior counseling is in high demand, particularly in the field of pediatric dental care. As a result, we decided to conduct this review specifically to examine the applications of AI models in pediatric dentistry. A comprehensive search of the subjects was done using a wide range of databases to look for studies that have been published in peer-reviewed journals from its inception until 31 December 2022. After the application of the criteria, only 25 of the 351 articles were taken into consideration for this review. According to the literature, AI is frequently used in pediatric dentistry for the purpose of making an accurate diagnosis and assisting clinicians, dentists, and pediatric dentists in clinical decision making, developing preventive strategies, and establishing an appropriate treatment plan.

AB  - <jats:p>Cryptography has been used from time immemorial for preserving the confidentiality of data/information in storage or transit. Thus, cryptography research has also been evolving from the classical Caesar cipher to the modern cryptosystems, based on modular arithmetic to the contemporary cryptosystems based on quantum computing. The emergence of quantum computing poses a major threat to the modern cryptosystems based on modular arithmetic, whereby even the computationally hard problems which constitute the strength of the modular arithmetic ciphers could be solved in polynomial time. This threat triggered post-quantum cryptography research to design and develop post-quantum algorithms that can withstand quantum computing attacks. This paper provides an overview of the various research directions that have been explored in post-quantum cryptography and, specifically, the various code-based cryptography research dimensions that have been explored. Some potential research directions that are yet to be explored in code-based cryptography research from the perspective of codes is a key contribution of this paper.</jats:p>

AB  - Currently, to measure the intracranial pressure (ICP) there are invasive probes, which need to be positioned intraoperatively during primary surgery or as an additional bed-side procedure through a standardized frontal approach targeting the lateral ventricular system or the white matter of the non-dominant or predominantly lesioned hemisphere. As this intraoperatively approach is linked with risks, the medical research aims to find potential correlators for the ICP by investigating different biomarkers. This paper proposes a machine learning approach to predict the ICP using standard periodic vital signs and identifying potential correlators by investigating the feature importance of the models instead of using basic statistics.

AB  - Internalin B-mediated activation of the membrane-bound receptor tyrosine kinase MET is accompanied by a change in receptor mobility. Conversely, it should be possible to infer from receptor mobility whether a cell has been treated with internalin B. Here, we propose a method based on hidden Markov modeling and explainable artificial intelligence that machine-learns the key differences in MET mobility between internalin B-treated and -untreated cells from single-particle tracking data. Our method assigns receptor mobility to three diffusion modes (immobile, slow, and fast). It discriminates between internalin B-treated and -untreated cells with a balanced accuracy of >99% and identifies three parameters that are most affected by internalin B treatment: a decrease in the mobility of slow molecules (1) and a depopulation of the fast mode (2) caused by an increased transition of fast molecules to the slow mode (3). Our approach is based entirely on free software and is readily applicable to the analysis of other membrane receptors.

AB  - Introduction. The Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS) is frequently used to measure frailty in critically ill adults. There is wide variation in the approach to analysing the relationship between the CFS score and mortality after admission to the ICU. Methods. We used data from two multicentre prospective cohort studies which enrolled very old intensive care unit patients in 26 countries to evaluate the influence of modelling approach on the association between the CFS score and mortality. The primary outcome was mortality within 30-days from admission to the ICU. Logistic regression models for both ICU and 30-day mortality included the CFS score as either a categorical, continuous or dichotomous variable and were adjusted for patient's age, sex, reason for admission to the ICU, and admission Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score. Results. The median age in the sample of 7487 consecutive patients was 84 years (IQR 81-87). The highest fraction of new prognostic information from frailty in the context of 30-day mortality was observed when the CFS score was treated as either a categorical variable using all original levels of frailty or a nonlinear continuous variable and was equal to 9% using these modelling approaches (p < 0.001). The relationship between the CFS score and mortality was nonlinear (p < 0.01). Conclusion. Knowledge about a patient's frailty status adds a substantial amount of new prognostic information at the moment of admission to the ICU. Arbitrary simplification of the CFS score into fewer groups than originally intended leads to a loss of information and should be avoided. 000444 Respiratory muscle strength is associated with functional exercise capacity in survivors of critical illness: a prospective cohort study with 6-month follow-up

AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Piping systems are common in many architectures and designing such systems is often a complex task. Design automation of piping systems is therefore a universal research subject. Nonetheless, these piping systems are often still designed by hand as a result of their complexity. Consequently, costs associated with piping design are high, especially for large-scale architectures like ships and chemical plants. The goal of automatic pipe routing is to reduce the design time and associated costs of a piping system by automating the routing of these pipes. This survey provides an overview of the current state of automatic pipe routing literature to assist researchers and practitioners to further the study of automatic pipe routing. This is done by pinpointing and explaining the most important obstacles that stand in the way of making a full-scale automatic pipe routing method. The barriers that are analyzed are related to both model representation and optimization complexity. Finally, a synthesis table of research papers on automatic pipe routing is provided based on the handling of the aforementioned barriers and other general features of automatic pipe routing methodology. The survey concludes by discussing directions for further research.</jats:p>

AB  - Localizing leakages in large water distribution systems is an important and ever-present problem. Due to the complexity originating from water pipeline networks, too few sensors, and noisy measurements, this is a highly challenging problem to solve. In this work, we present a methodology based on generative deep learning and Bayesian inference for leak localization with uncertainty quantification. A generative model, utilizing deep neural networks, serves as a probabilistic surrogate model that replaces the full equations, while at the same time also incorporating the uncertainty inherent in such models. By embedding this surrogate model into a Bayesian inference scheme, leaks are located by combining sensor observations with a model output approximating the true posterior distribution for possible leak locations. We show that our methodology enables producing fast, accurate, and trustworthy results. It showed a convincing performance on three problems with increasing complexity. For a simple test case, the Hanoi network, the average topological distance (ATD) between the predicted and true leak location ranged from 0.3 to 3 with a varying number of sensors and level of measurement noise. For two more complex test cases, the ATD ranged from 0.75 to 4 and from 1.5 to 10, respectively. Furthermore, accuracies upwards of 83%, 72%, and 42% were achieved for the three test cases, respectively. The computation times ranged from 0.1 to 13 s, depending on the size of the neural network employed. This work serves as an example of a digital twin for a sophisticated application of advanced mathematical and deep learning techniques in the area of leak detection.

AB  - The goal of this research is to figure out how to calculate academic achievements and students' cognitive quotients for placement. This study will attempt to forecast students' intelligence quotients or academic grades to measure the IQ of a student in a holistic manner using all kinds of parameters, from students' academic records to input from their professors and even their family background, thus creating a dataset of 9000 instances with all these data. We implemented and trained multiple machine learning algorithms on the data and collected the outcomes to select the best algorithm. Students' quantitative reasoning ability was selected as a parameter that could be assessed by their performance on aptitude tests. Certifications of the student during their bachelor's degree have been considered, which would also give us an idea about the student's critical and logical thinking ability. All the parameters were rated on a scale of 1-10. The driving motivation behind this investigation was to discover what parameters force a student to be placed in a company then the final overall "student score" is calculated to determine a student's intelligence quotient. The final IQ score of the student-generated was graded on a scale of 0-3 and a suitable salary package range for the student was estimated giving the company a good idea of the student's capability.

AB  - The prediction of heart failure survivors is a challenging task and helps medical professionals to make the right decisions about patients. Expertise and experience of medical professionals are required to care for heart failure patients. Machine Learning models can help with understanding symptoms of cardiac disease. However, manual feature engineering is challenging and requires expertise to select the appropriate technique. This study proposes a smart healthcare framework using the Internet-of-Things (IoT) and cloud technologies that improve heart failure patients' survival prediction without considering manual feature engineering. The smart IoT-based framework monitors patients on the basis of real-time data and provides timely, effective, and quality healthcare services to heart failure patients. The proposed model also investigates deep learning models in classifying heart failure patients as alive or deceased. The framework employs IoT-based sensors to obtain signals and send them to the cloud web server for processing. These signals are further processed by deep learning models to determine the state of patients. Patients' health records and processing results are shared with a medical professional who will provide emergency help if required. The dataset used in this study contains 13 features and was attained from the UCI repository known as Heart Failure Clinical Records. The experimental results revealed that the CNN model is superior to other deep learning and machine learning models with a 0.9289 accuracy value.

AB  - Due to the low scoring nature of football (soccer), shots are often used as a proxy to evaluate team and player performances. However, not all shots are created equally and their quality differs significantly depending on the situation. The aim of this study is to objectively quantify the quality of any given shot by introducing a so-called expected goals (xG) model. This model is validated statistically and with professional match analysts. The best performing model uses an extreme gradient boosting algorithm and is based on hand-crafted features from synchronized positional and event data of 105, 627 shots in the German Bundesliga. With a ranked probability score (RPS) of 0.197, it is more accurate than any previously published expected goals model. This approach allows us to assess team and player performances far more accurately than is possible with traditional metrics by focusing on process rather than results.

                     </jats:title><jats:p>Model-independent search strategies have been increasingly proposed in recent years because on the one hand there has been no clear signal for new physics and on the other hand there is a lack of a highly probable and parameter-free extension of the standard model. For these reasons, there is no simple search target so far. In this work, we try to take a new direction and ask the question: bearing in mind that we have a large number of new physics theories that go beyond the Standard Model and may contain a grain of truth, can we improve our search strategy for unknown signals by using them “in combination”? In particular, we show that a signal hypothesis based on a large, intermingled set of many different theoretical signal models can be a superior approach to find an unknown BSM signal. Applied to a recent data challenge, we show that “mixture-of-theories training” outperforms strategies that optimize signal regions with a single BSM model as well as most unsupervised strategies. Applications of this work include anomaly detection and the definition of signal regions in the search for signals of new physics.</jats:p>

Based on traditional behavioral scales, there is a high rate of misdiagnosis for subtypes of DoC. We aimed to explore whether topological characterization may explain the pathological mechanisms of DoC and be effective in diagnosing the subtypes of DoC.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="Methods" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">Using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data, the weighted brain functional networks for normal control subjects and patients with vegetative state (VS) and minimally conscious state (MCS) were constructed. Global and local network characteristics of each group were analyzed. A support vector machine was employed to identify MCS and VS patients.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="Results" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">The average connection strength was reduced in DoC patients and roughly equivalent in MCS and VS groups. Global efficiency, local efficiency, and clustering coefficients were reduced, and characteristic path length was increased in DoC patients (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). For patients of both groups, global network measures were not significantly different (<i>p</i> &gt; 0.05). Nodal efficiency, nodal local efficiency, and nodal clustering coefficient were reduced in frontoparietal brain areas, limbic structures, and occipital and temporal brain areas (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). The comparison of nodal centrality suggested that DoC causes reorganization of the network structure on a large scale, especially the thalamus. Lobal network measures emphasized that the differences between the two groups of patients mainly involved frontoparietal brain areas. The accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of the classifier for identifying MCS and VS patients were 89.83, 78.95, and 95%, respectively.</AbstractText>

AB  - A fully homomorphic encryption system hides data from unauthorized parties, while still allowing them to perform computations on the encrypted data. Aside from the straightforward benefit of allowing users to delegate computations to a more powerful server without revealing their inputs, a fully homomorphic cryptosystem can be used as a building block in the construction of a number of cryptographic functionalities. Designing such a scheme remained an open problem until 2009, decades after the idea was first conceived, and the past few years have seen the generalization of this functionality to the world of quantum machines. Quantum schemes prior to the one implemented here were able to replicate some features in particular use-cases often associated with homomorphic encryption but lacked other crucial properties, for example, relying on continual interaction to perform a computation or leaking information about the encrypted data. We present the first experimental realisation of a quantum fully homomorphic encryption scheme. We further present a toy two-party secure computation task enabled by our scheme. Finally, as part of our implementation, we also demonstrate a post-selective two-qubit linear optical controlled-phase gate with a much higher post-selection success probability (1/2) when compared to alternate implementations, e.g. with post-selective controlled-Z or controlled-X gates (1/9).

AB  - <jats:p>Soccer is evolving into a science rather than just a sport, driven by intense competition between professional teams. This transformation requires efforts beyond physical training, including strategic planning, data analysis, and advanced metrics. Coaches and teams increasingly use sophisticated methods and data-driven insights to enhance decision-making. Analyzing team performance is crucial to prepare players and coaches, enabling targeted training and strategic adjustments. Expected goals (xG) analysis plays a key role in assessing team and individual player performance, providing nuanced insights into on-field actions and opportunities. This approach allows coaches to optimize tactics and lineup choices beyond traditional scorelines. However, relying solely on xG might not provide a full picture of player performance, as a higher xG does not always translate into more goals due to the intricacies and variabilities of in-game situations. This paper seeks to refine performance assessments by incorporating predictions for both expected goals (xG) and actual goals (aG). Using this new model, we consider a wider variety of factors to provide a more comprehensive evaluation of players and teams. Another major focus of our study is to present a method for selecting and categorizing players based on their predicted xG and aG performance. Additionally, this paper discusses expected goals and actual goals for each individual game; consequently, we use expected goals per game (xGg) and actual goals per game (aGg) to reflect them. Moreover, we employ regression machine learning models, particularly ridge regression, which demonstrates strong performance in forecasting xGg and aGg, outperforming other models in our comparative assessment. Ridge regression’s ability to handle overlapping and correlated variables makes it an ideal choice for our analysis. This approach improves prediction accuracy and provides actionable insights for coaches and analysts to optimize team performance. By using constructed features from various methods in the dataset, we improve our model’s performance by as much as 12%. These features offer a more detailed understanding of player performance in specific leagues and roles, improving the model’s accuracy from 83% to nearly 95%, as indicated by the R-squared metric. Furthermore, our research introduces a player selection methodology based on their predicted xG and aG, as determined by our proposed model. According to our model’s classification, we categorize top players into two groups: efficient scorers and consistent performers. These precise forecasts can guide strategic decisions, player selection, and training approaches, ultimately enhancing team performance and success.</jats:p>

We consider the associated production of the top quark with a W-boson and identify different observables to discriminate the signal from the Standard Model (SM) background events.

AB  - Encountering difficulties that emerge in programming learning are ubiquitous for novices. Those difficulties may reduce novices’ motivation for learning, even lead them to drop out. Automatically detecting the difficulties has been proved as an effective way to solve this problem. A potential method for the detection is to identify programmers’ behavioural patterns based on the sequences of programming events (e.g., editing, deleting, or debugging) when they experience programming difficulties. However, due to the diversity of these events, the plentiful difficulties generated from novices, and the naturally complicated behavioural patterns, accurately detecting the difficulties remains challenging. In this study, we propose a deep representation based on the programming events as the pre-treatment of a recurrent neural network with an attention mechanism to detect programming difficulty. This representation can be conducive to encode the complicated behavioural features (e.g., co-occurrence, sequences, and time intervals of the events) of the difficulty patterns for deep learning models. The results show that the accuracy of our method reaches 94%, which increases by 16% compared with the traditional machine learning model.

AB  - Football is a very result-driven industry, with goals being rarer than in most sports, so having further parameters to judge the performance of teams and individuals is key. Expected Goals (xG) allow further insight than just a scoreline. To tackle the need for further analysis in football, this paper uses machine learning methods that are developed and applied to Football Event data. The proposed solution utilises StatsBomb as the data provider and an industry benchmark to tune the models in the right direction. The proposed ML solution for xG is further used to tackle the age-old cliche of: 'the ball has fallen to the wrong guy there'. To investigate this, we tackle Positional Adjusted xG, splitting the training data into Forward, Midfield, and Defence to provide insight into player qualities based on their positional sub-group. Positional Adjusted xG successfully predicts and proves that more attacking players are better at accumulating xG. Finally, this study has further developments into Player Adjusted xG to prove that Messi is statistically at a higher efficiency level than the average footballer. Thanks to this analysis, we conclude that the Messi model performs 347 xG higher than the general model outcome.

AB  - <i>Cryptococcus neoformans</i> is the most common cause of fungal meningitis and the top-ranked W.H.O. priority fungal pathogen. Only distantly related to model fungi, <i>C. neoformans</i> is also a powerful experimental system for exploring conserved eukaryotic mechanisms lost from specialist model yeast lineages. To decipher its biology globally, we constructed 4328 gene deletions and measured-with exceptional precision--the fitness of each mutant under 141 diverse growth-limiting <i>in vitro</i> conditions and during murine infection. We defined functional modules by clustering genes based on their phenotypic signatures. In-depth studies leveraged these data in two ways. First, we defined and investigated new components of key signaling pathways, which revealed animal-like pathways/components not predicted from studies of model yeasts. Second, we identified environmental adaptation mechanisms repurposed to promote mammalian virulence by <i>C. neoformans</i>, which lacks a known animal reservoir. Our work provides an unprecedented resource for deciphering a deadly human pathogen.

AB  - Wind turbine faults, including electrical, mechanical or aerodynamics-related, can potentially reduce operational efficiency, causing downtimes or, in some cases, leading to severe damage. Hence, timely detection of these operational anomalies is crucial for optimizing performance and reducing maintenance costs. The following study explores the application of Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) data for fault detection and diagnosing different operational states in wind turbines by focusing on environmental and operational factors which affect the performance. An efficient noise-resilient classification framework is proposed which includes a novel Perturbed-Random Forest (P-RF) algorithm to diagnose operational states with high accuracy even under noisy conditions. Seasonal discrepancies in power generation are analyzed using theoretical and actual power analysis. Further, distributions of features are realized via kernel density estimation and efficiency metrics in order to identify performance inefficiencies. The P-RF algorithm achieved 99.72% accuracy in diagnosing the status of the SCADA-based wind turbine although with a slightly higher computational complexity than a baseline Random Forest algorithm. Multiple Evaluation metrics were employed to assess the performance of the proposed model under different signal-to-noise conditions.

AB  - Abstract Ecosystem complexity is among the important drivers of biodiversity and ecosystem functioning, and unmanned aerial systems (UASs) are becoming an important tool for characterizing vegetation patterns and processes. The variety of UASs applications is immense, and so are the procedures to process UASs data described in the literature. Optimizing the workflow is still a matter of discussion. Here, we present a comprehensive synthesis aiming to identify common rules that shape workflows applied in UAS-based studies facing complexity in ecosystems. Analysing the studies, we found similarities irrespective of the ecosystem, according to the character of the property addressed, such as species composition (biodiversity), ecosystem structure (stand volume/complexity), plant status (phenology and stress levels), and dynamics (disturbances and regeneration). We propose a general framework allowing to design UAS-based vegetation surveys according to its purpose and the component of ecosystem complexity addressed. We support the framework by detailed schemes as well as examples of best practices of UAS studies covering each of the vegetation properties (i.e. composition, structure, status and dynamics) and related applications. For an efficient UAS survey, the following points are crucial: knowledge of the phenomenon, choice of platform, sensor, resolution (temporal, spatial and spectral), model and classification algorithm according to the phenomenon, as well as careful interpretation of the results. The simpler the procedure, the more robust, repeatable, applicable and cost effective it is. Therefore, the proper design can minimize the efforts while maximizing the quality of the results.

AB  - The past decade has seen an increasing interest in designing sophisticated density functional approximations (DFAs) by integrating the power of machine learning (ML) techniques. However, application of the ML-based DFAs is often confined to simple model systems. In this work, we construct an ML correction to the widely used Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) functional by establishing a semilocal mapping from the electron density and reduced gradient to the exchange-correlation energy density. The resulting ML-corrected PBE is immediately applicable to any real molecule, and yields significantly improved heats of formation while preserving the accuracy for other thermochemical and kinetic properties. This work highlights the prospect of combining the power of data-driven ML methods with physics-inspired derivations for reaching the heaven of chemical accuracy.

AB  - The quest to identify materials with tailored properties is increasingly expanding into high-order composition spaces, with a corresponding combinatorial explosion in the number of candidate materials. A key challenge is to discover regions in composition space where materials have novel properties. Traditional predictive models for material properties are not accurate enough to guide the search. Herein, we use high-throughput measurements of optical properties to identify novel regions in three-cation metal oxide composition spaces by identifying compositions whose optical trends cannot be explained by simple phase mixtures. We screen 376,752 distinct compositions from 108 three-cation oxide systems based on the cation elements Mg, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Y, In, Sn, Ce, and Ta. Data models for candidate phase diagrams and three-cation compositions with emergent optical properties guide the discovery of materials with complex phase-dependent properties, as demonstrated by the discovery of a Co-Ta-Sn substitutional alloy oxide with tunable transparency, catalytic activity, and stability in strong acid electrolytes. These results required close coupling of data validation to experiment design to generate a reliable end-to-end high-throughput workflow for accelerating scientific discovery.

AB  - The model uncertainties and the heterogeneous energy states burden the effective aggregation of electric vehicles (EVs), especially coupling with the real-time frequency dynamic of the electrical grid. Integrating the advantages of deep learning and reinforcement learning, deep reinforcement learning shows its potential to relieve this challenge, where an intelligent agent fully considers the individual state of charge (SOC) difference of EV and the grid state to optimize the aggregation performance. However, existing policies of deep reinforcement learning usually provide deterministic and certain actions, and it is difficult to deal with the increasing uncertainties and randomness in modern electrical systems. In this paper, a probability-based management strategy is proposed with continuous action space based on the deep reinforcement learning, which provides fine-grained energy management and addresses the time-varying dynamics from EVs and electrical grid simultaneously. Moreover, an optimization based on the proximal policy is further introduced to clip the policy upgradation speed to enhance the training stability. The effectiveness of proposed energy management structure and policy optimization strategy are verified on various scenarios and uncertainties, which demonstrates advantageous performance in the SOC management and frequency maintenance. Besides the performance merits, the training procedure is also presented revealing the evolution reason for the proposed approach.

AB  - Managerial myopia occurs when executives value short-term benefits to the extent that firm long-run development will be obstructed. Recent studies have shown that the locality effect plays an important role in managerial myopia-local United States chief executive officers (CEOs) who work near their home states are less likely to behave myopically because of more effective monitoring and greater reputation concern. In an emerging market, government policies play a more important role in the strategic planning enterprises. A local CEO may have better understanding of local government's policies thus makes less short-term decisions. This article adds to this literature by testing whether local-province CEOs in China, i.e., the CEO's native place or birthplace is in the same province as her company's headquarters, are also far-sighted. Using data on 470 publicly listed non-state-owned Chinese firms from 2014 to 2018, supportive evidence has been found that non-local-province CEOs in China tend to cut R&D expenses for beating analyst forecasts, reversing earnings decline, or pursuing higher returns. This article also confirms social capital as one mechanism of Chinese local-province CEOs behaving less myopically. This investigation also adds to the literature by revealing a new mechanism that CEO locality in China has a positive and direct bearing on how governments support corporate innovation.

AB  - Background: Currently, there are two methods for testing maximal oxygen uptake: the direct and indirect methods, but both have certain requirements for testing equipment, site, and personnel. There is a lack of a convenient and effective method for testing maximum oxygen uptake (VO2max). With the development of artificial neural network (ANN), a solution to this gap is provided. Objective: The goal of this study was to design a method to evaluate the cardiopulmonary function of young people and verify its feasibility and reliability. Methods: The incremental squat test (IST) and Young Men’s Christian Association (YMCA) test were designed with 196 subjects (97 males and 99 females). The back propagation (BP) neural network was used to construct the model of VO2max by recording and analyzing squatting times, height, weight, gender, age, leg length, Manou Riers Skelic index (MRSI), and VO2max. Results: Three hidden layers and 65 nodes were employed in the BP neural network. Each hidden layer contained 19 nodes. Other parameters of this network were 0.01, 0.9, and 2000 for the learning rate, momentum, and iterations, respectively. The difference between the measurements and predictions was not significant (p &gt; 0.05), and the correlation between them was extremely strong (r = 0.98, p &lt; 0.01). Conclusions: We conclude that the model constructed using the BP neural network is accurate, and the IST is feasible for predicting VO2max. This method can be used as a substitute for other cardiopulmonary fitness test protocols in cases of insufficient venues and equipment. thereby preventing health complications. In subsequent studies, the sample size should be expanded, and separate prediction models should be developed for different genders.

AB  - Hybrid simulation (HS) combines analytical modeling with experimental testing to provide a better understanding of both structural elements and entire systems while keeping cost-effective solutions. However, extending real-time HS (RTHS) to bigger problems becomes challenging when the analytical models get more complex. On the other hand, using machine learning (ML) techniques in solving engineering problems across the different disciplines keep evolving and likewise, is promising resource for structural engineering. The main goal of this study is to explore the validity of ML models for conducting RTHS and specifically introduce and validate the necessary communication schemes to achieve this goal. A preliminary study with a simplified linear regression ML model, that can be readily implemented in Simulink, is presented first to introduce the idea of using metamodels as analytical substructures. However, for ML, commonly used platforms for RTHS such as Simulink and Matlab have limited capacity when compared to Python for instance. Thus, the main focus of this study was to introduce Python-based advanced ML models for RTHS analytical substructures. Deep long short-term memory (LSTM) networks in Python were considered for the advanced metamodeling for RTHS tests. The performance of Python can be enhanced by running the models using high-performance computers, which was also considered in this study. Several RTHS tests were successfully conducted at the University of Nevada, Reno with Python-based ML algorithms that were run from both local PC and a cluster. The tests were validated through comparisons with the pure analytical solutions obtained from finite element models. The study also explored the idea of eliminating delay compensators when ML models are used for RTHS.

AB  - This study examines the formidable and complex challenge of insider threats to organizational security, addressing risks such as ransomware incidents, data breaches, and extortion attempts. The research involves six experiments utilizing email, HTTP, and file content data. To combat insider threats, emerging Natural Language Processing techniques are employed in conjunction with powerful Machine Learning classifiers, specifically XGBoost and AdaBoost. The focus is on recognizing the sentiment and context of malicious actions, which are considered less prone to change compared to commonly tracked metrics like location and time of access. To enhance detection, a term frequency-inverse document frequency-based approach is introduced, providing a more robust, adaptable, and maintainable method. Moreover, the study acknowledges the significant impact of hyperparameter selection on classifier performance and employs various contemporary optimizers, including a modified version of the red fox optimization algorithm. The proposed approach undergoes testing in three simulated scenarios using a public dataset, showcasing commendable outcomes.

AB  - Due to the continuous increasing importance of renewable energy sources as an alternative to fossil fuels, to contrast air pollution and global warming, the prediction of Global Horizontal Irradiation (GHI), one of the main parameters determining solar energy production of photovoltaic systems, represents an attractive topic nowadays. Solar irradiance is determined by deterministic factors (i.e. the position of the sun) and stochastic factors (i.e. the presence of clouds). Since the stochastic element is difficult to model, this problem can benefit from machine learning techniques, like artificial neural networks. This work proposes a methodology to forecast GHI in short- (i.e. from 15 min to 60 min) and mid-term (i.e. from 60 to 120 min) time horizons. For this purpose, we designed, optimised and compared four neural network architectures for time-series forecasting, respectively based on: i) Non-Linear Autoregressive, ii) Feed-Forward, iii) Long Short-Term Memory and iv) Echo State Network. The original data-set, consisting of GHI values sampled every 15min, has been pre-processed by applying different filtering techniques. Our results analysis compares the performance of the proposed neural networks identifying the best in terms of error rate and forecast horizon. This analysis highlights that the clear-sky index results the preferred filtering technique by giving greatly improvements in data-set pre-processing, and Echo State Network gives best accuracy results.

AB  - <AbstractText Label="Introduction" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">Constructing an accurate and comprehensive knowledge graph of specific diseases is critical for practical clinical disease diagnosis and treatment, reasoning and decision support, rehabilitation, and health management. For knowledge graph construction tasks (such as named entity recognition, relation extraction), classical BERT-based methods require a large amount of training data to ensure model performance. However, real-world medical annotation data, especially disease-specific annotation samples, are very limited. In addition, existing models do not perform well in recognizing out-of-distribution entities and relations that are not seen in the training phase.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="Method" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">In this study, we present a novel and practical pipeline for constructing a heart failure knowledge graph using large language models and medical expert refinement. We apply prompt engineering to the three phases of schema design: schema design, information extraction, and knowledge completion. The best performance is achieved by designing task-specific prompt templates combined with the TwoStepChat approach.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="Results" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">Experiments on two datasets show that the TwoStepChat method outperforms the Vanillia prompt and outperforms the fine-tuned BERT-based baselines. Moreover, our method saves 65% of the time compared to manual annotation and is better suited to extract the out-of-distribution information in the real world.</AbstractText>

AB  - Aim. Our research examined the predictive capabilities of mathematical models that are solely based on the expected goal statistics obtained from a publicly available database.
Method. We collected match and expected goals data for 310 matches from three European Leagues (Bundesliga, La Liga, and Serie A). We created three probabilistic models based on the expected goals statistic and compared them with two well-established probabilistic models using binomial deviance, squared error, and profitability in the betting market as evaluation metrics.
Results. Our best model adjusted the expected goal statistics for homefield advantage and outperformed the two probabilistic models used for comparison. Two of our models were profitable under certain betting conditions.
Limitations. Our models explored a simplistic integration of expected goals into a Poisson based probabilistic model and did not include other contributing factors such as a team’s defensive prowess. The number of games simulated was also limited due to the premature closure of the European Leagues due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Conclusions. The use of a probabilistic model based solely on expected goals score statistic can provide some meaningful insight into forecasting the outcome of a football match and can develop useful betting strategies.

AB  - At present, with the growing number of Web 2.0 platforms such as Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter, users honestly communicate their opinions and ideas about events, services, and products. Owing to this rise in the number of social platforms and their extensive use by people, enormous amounts of data are produced hourly. However, sentiment analysis or opinion mining is considered as a useful tool that aims to extract the emotion and attitude from the user-posted data on social media platforms by using different computational methods to linguistic terms and various Natural Language Processing (NLP). Therefore, enhancing text sentiment classification accuracy has become feasible, and an interesting research area for many community researchers. In this study, a new Fuzzy Deep Learning Classifier (FDLC) is suggested for improving the performance of data-sentiment classification. Our proposed FDLC integrates Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to build an effective automatic process for extracting the features from collected unstructured data and Feedforward Neural Network (FFNN) to compute both positive and negative sentimental scores. Then, we used the Mamdani Fuzzy System (MFS) as a fuzzy classifier to classify the outcomes of the two used deep (CNN+FFNN) learning models in three classes, which are: Neutral, Negative, and Positive. Also, to prevent the long execution time taking by our hybrid proposed FDLC, we have implemented our proposal under the Hadoop cluster. An experimental comparative study between our FDLC and some other suggestions from the literature is performed to demonstrate our offered classifier’s effectiveness. The empirical result proved that our FDLC performs better than other classifiers in terms of true positive rate, true negative rate, false positive rate, false negative rate, error rate, precision, classification rate, kappa statistic, F1-score and time consumption, complexity, convergence, and stability.

AB  - Understanding humoral responses to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is critical for improving diagnostics, therapeutics, and vaccines. Deep serological profiling of 232 coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients and 190 pre-COVID-19 era controls using VirScan revealed more than 800 epitopes in the SARS-CoV-2 proteome, including 10 epitopes likely recognized by neutralizing antibodies. Preexisting antibodies in controls recognized SARS-CoV-2 ORF1, whereas only COVID-19 patient antibodies primarily recognized spike protein and nucleoprotein. A machine learning model trained on VirScan data predicted SARS-CoV-2 exposure history with 99% sensitivity and 98% specificity; a rapid Luminex-based diagnostic was developed from the most discriminatory SARS-CoV-2 peptides. Individuals with more severe COVID-19 exhibited stronger and broader SARS-CoV-2 responses, weaker antibody responses to prior infections, and higher incidence of cytomegalovirus and herpes simplex virus 1, possibly influenced by demographic covariates. Among hospitalized patients, males produce stronger SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses than females.

AB  - <jats:p>Abstract: In recent years, the construction engineering sector has undergone a transformative shift towards the integration of machine learning (ML) techniques, particularly in predicting the properties of steel fiber-reinforced concrete (SFRC). Despite the theoretical sophistication of existing models, a persistent challenge remains – their opacity, lacking transparency and real-world relevance for practi-tioners. To address this gap and advance our current understanding, this study employs the extra gradient (XG) Boosting algorithm, crafting a comprehensive ap-proach. Grounded in a meticulously curated database drawn from 43 seminal pub-lications, encompassing 420 distinct records, this research focuses predominantly on three primary fiber types: crimped, hooked, and mil-cut. Complemented by hands-on experimentation involving 20 diverse SFRC mixtures, this empirical campaign is further illuminated through the strategic use of Partial Dependence Plots (PDPs), revealing intricate relationships between input parameters and con-sequent compressive strength. A pivotal revelation of this research lies in the identification of optimal SFRC formulations, offering tangible insights for real-world applications. The developed ML model stands out not only for its sophistication but also its tangible accuracy, evidenced by exemplary performance against inde-pendent datasets, boasting a commendable mean target-prediction ratio of 99%. To bridge the theory-practice gap, we introduce a user-friendly digital interface, thri-ughly designed to guide professionals in optimizing and accurately predicting the compressive strength of SFRC. This research thus contributes to the construction and civil engineering sectors by enhancing predictive capabilities and refining mix designs, fostering innovation, and addressing the evolving needs of the industry.</jats:p>

AB  - <jats:p>Water covers around 3/4th of our planet’s surface and is one of the most significant sources of energy for the continuation of life on the planet. In the wake of rapid urbanization and industrialization, water quality has declined at an alarming rate, leading to the spread of life-threatening illnesses and diseases. The consequences of polluted water are far-reaching, affecting every area of human existence. As a result, effective management of water is critical to ensuring that the water's quality is optimized. When data is evaluated and water quality predictions are made in advance, the consequences of water pollution may be dealt with more effectively. There have been many prior studies that have addressed this problem; nevertheless, there is still more work that needs to be done to improve the efficacy, dependability, accuracy, and usefulness of the existing water quality management methods. The goal of this research is to predict water portability by comparing the accuracy of six different machine learning models on a dataset containing water quality metrics for 3276 different water bodies and 10 features.</jats:p>

AB  - Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a leading cause of liver disease. The capsid is an essential component of the virion and it is therefore of interest how it assembles and disassembles. The capsid protein is unusual both for its rare fold and that it polymerizes according to two different icosahedral symmetries, causing the polypeptide chain to exist in seven quasi-equivalent environments: A, B, and C in AB and CC dimers in T = 3 capsids, and A, B, C, and D in AB and CD dimers in T = 4 capsids. We have compared the two capsids by cryo-EM at 3.5 A resolution. To ensure a valid comparison, the two capsids were prepared and imaged under identical conditions. We find that the chains have different conformations and potential energies, with the T = 3 C chain having the lowest. Three of the four quasi-equivalent dimers are asymmetric with respect to conformation and potential energy; however, the T = 3 CC dimer is symmetrical and has the lowest potential energy although its intra-dimer interface has the least free energy of formation. Of all the inter-dimer interfaces, the CB interface has the least area and free energy, in both capsids. From the calculated energies of higher-order groupings of dimers discernible in the lattices we predict early assembly intermediates, and indeed we observe such structures by negative stain EM of in vitro assembly reactions. By sequence analysis and computational alanine scanning we identify key residues and motifs involved in capsid assembly. Our results explain several previously reported observations on capsid assembly, disassembly, and dimorphism.

AB  - Depression in the elderly is an important social issue considering the population aging of the world. In particular, elderly living alone who has narrowed social relationship due to bereavement and retirement are more prone to be depressed. Long-term depressed mood can be a precursor to eventual depression as a disease. Our goal is how to predict the depressed mood of single household elderly from unobtrusive monitoring of their daily life. We have selected a wearable band with multiple sensors for monitoring elderly people. Depression questionnaire has been surveyed periodically to be used as the labels. Instead of working with depression patients, we recruited 14 single household elderly people from a nearby community. The wearable band provided daily activity and biometric data for 71 days. From the data, we generate a depressed mood prediction model. Multiple features from the collected sensor data are exploited for model generation. One general model is generated to be used as the baseline for the initial model deployment. Personal models are also generated for model refinement. The general model has a high recall of 80% in an MLP model. Individual models achieved an average recall of 82.7%. In this study, we have demonstrated that we can generate depressed mood prediction models with data collected from real daily living. Our work has shown the feasibility of using a wearable band as an unobtrusive depression monitoring sensor even for elderly people.

In this paper, these applications are reviewed from the perspectives of identifying, forecasting, and parameterizing ocean phenomena. Specifically, the usage of AI algorithms for the identification of mesoscale eddies, internal waves, oil spills, sea ice, and marine algae are discussed in this paper. Additionally, AI-based forecasting of surface waves, the El Niño Southern Oscillation, and storm surges is discussed. This is followed by a discussion on the usage of these schemes to parameterize oceanic turbulence and atmospheric moist physics. Moreover, physics-informed deep learning and neural networks are discussed within an oceanographic context, and further applications with ocean digital twins and physics-constrained AI algorithms are described. This review is meant to introduce beginners and experts in the marine sciences to AI methodologies and stimulate future research toward the usage of causality-adherent physics-informed neural networks and Fourier neural networks in oceanography.</jats:p>

AB  - <AbstractText Label="BACKGROUND">Accurate age estimation is vital for clinical and forensic purposes. With the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence(AI) technologies, traditional methods relying on tooth development, while reliable, can be enhanced by leveraging deep learning, particularly neural networks. This study evaluated the efficiency of an AI model by applying the entire panoramic image for age estimation. The outcome performances were analyzed through supervised learning (SL) models.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="METHODS">Total of 27,877 dental panorama images from 5 to 90 years of age were classified by 2 types of grouping. In type 1 they were classified by each age and in type 2, applying heuristic grouping, the age over 20 years were classified by every 5 years. Wide ResNet (WRN) and DenseNet (DN) were used for supervised learning. In addition, the analysis with ± 3 years of deviation in both types were performed.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="RESULTS">For the DN model, while the type 1 grouping achieved an accuracy of 0.1016 and F1 score of 0.058, the type 2 achieved an accuracy of 0.3146 and F1 score of 0.2027. Incorporating ± 3years of deviation, the accuracy of type 1 and 2 were 0.281, 0.7323 respectively; and the F1 score were 0.1768, 0.6583 respectively. For the WRN model, while the type 1 grouping achieved an accuracy of 0.1041 and F1 score of 0.0599, the type 2 achieved an accuracy of 0.3182 and F1 score of 0.2071. Incorporating ± 3years of deviation, the accuracy of type 1 and 2 were 0.2716, 0.7323 respectively; and the F1 score were 0.1709, 0.6437 respectively.</AbstractText>

AB  - In simulations of multiscale dynamical systems, not all relevant processes can be resolved explicitly. Taking the effect of the unresolved processes into account is important, which introduces the need for parameterizations. We present a machine-learning method, used for the conditional resampling of observations or reference data from a fully resolved simulation. It is based on the probabilistic classification of subsets of reference data, conditioned on macroscopic variables. This method is used to formulate a parameterization that is stochastic, taking the uncertainty of the unresolved scales into account. We validate our approach on the Lorenz 96 system, using two different parameter settings which are challenging for parameterization methods.

AB  - As multifactorial and chronic diseases, cancers are among these pathologies for which the exposome concept is essential to gain more insight into the associated etiology and, ultimately, lead to better primary prevention strategies for public health. Indeed, cancers result from the combined influence of many genetic, environmental and behavioral stressors that may occur simultaneously and interact. It is thus important to properly account for multifactorial exposure patterns when estimating specific cancer risks at individual or population level. Nevertheless, the risk factors, especially environmental, are still too often considered in isolation in epidemiological studies. Moreover, major statistical difficulties occur when exposures to several factors are highly correlated due, for instance, to common sources shared by several pollutants. Suitable statistical methods must then be used to deal with these multicollinearity issues. In this work, we focused on the specific problem of estimating a disease risk from highly correlated environmental exposure covariates and a censored survival outcome. We extended Bayesian profile regression mixture (PRM) models to this context by assuming an instantaneous excess hazard ratio disease sub-model. The proposed hierarchical model incorporates an underlying truncated Dirichlet process mixture as an attribution sub-model. A specific adaptive Metropolis-Within-Gibbs algorithm-including label switching moves-was implemented to infer the model. This allows simultaneously clustering individuals with similar risks and similar exposure characteristics and estimating the associated risk for each group. Our Bayesian PRM model was applied to the estimation of the risk of death by lung cancer in a cohort of French uranium miners who were chronically and occupationally exposed to multiple and correlated sources of ionizing radiation. Several groups of uranium miners with high risk and low risk of death by lung cancer were identified and characterized by specific exposure profiles. Interestingly, our case study illustrates a limit of MCMC algorithms to fit full Bayesian PRM models even if the updating schemes for the cluster labels incorporate label-switching moves. Then, although this paper shows that Bayesian PRM models are promising tools for exposome research, it also opens new avenues for methodological research in this class of probabilistic models.

AB  - Forecasting the direction and trend of stock price is an important task which helps investors to make prudent financial decisions in the stock market. Investment in the stock market has a big risk associated with it. Minimizing prediction error reduces the investment risk. Machine learning (ML) models typically perform better than statistical and econometric models. Also, ensemble ML models have been shown in the literature to be able to produce superior performance than single ML models. In this work, we compare the effectiveness of tree-based ensemble ML models (Random Forest (RF), XGBoost Classifier (XG), Bagging Classifier (BC), AdaBoost Classifier (Ada), Extra Trees Classifier (ET), and Voting Classifier (VC)) in forecasting the direction of stock price movement. Eight different stock data from three stock exchanges (NYSE, NASDAQ, and NSE) are randomly collected and used for the study. Each data set is split into training and test set. Ten-fold cross validation accuracy is used to evaluate the ML models on the training set. In addition, the ML models are evaluated on the test set using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, specificity, and area under receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC-ROC). Kendall W test of concordance is used to rank the performance of the tree-based ML algorithms. For the training set, the AdaBoost model performed better than the rest of the models. For the test set, accuracy, precision, F1-score, and AUC metrics generated results significant to rank the models, and the Extra Trees classifier outperformed the other models in all the rankings.

AB  - <jats:p xml:lang="en">The work in this thesis is the result of answers that we aimed to find for clinical questions. We initially focused on critically-ill sepsis patients, but when faced with the COVID-19 pandemic in the intensive care unit in 2020, we broadened our scope to also include COVID-19 patients.

In Part I of this thesis, we developed a scale to evaluate machine learning (ML) readiness. Although AI is poised to reshape medicine, routine clinical care in the ICU remains devoid of AI solutions. In Chapter 2 we hypothesized that machine learning models follow a trajectory towards clinical practice similar to aerospace technology. We found that 93% of all critical care AI models were in the prototyping and model development stage. Only two articles shadow tested their models, which means integrating a model into the electronic health system without presenting the results to clinicians, and only two publications evaluated models against clinically relevant outcomes.

Secondly, we evaluated the diagnostic test accuracy of all identifiable machine learning models to predict the onset of sepsis. We found 28 papers that contained 130 models eligible for inclusion. Overall, machine learning models were able to accurately predict sepsis onset on retrospective data. However, only 6.2% of these models were implemented prospectively and only one study was implemented in clinical practice.

Part II of this thesis describes the unification of clinical data from ICU patients with COVID-19. Both Chapter 4 and 5 describe the legal and technical details of the Dutch Data Warehouse (DDW), which contains 3464 patients from 25 hospitals, both from wave 1 (before the summer of 2020) and wave 2 in the Netherlands.

In parallel with data collection for the DDW, we addressed several questions that came up from clinical care for COVID-19 patients. In Part III, Chapter 6, we identified the risk factors for extubation failure in COVID-19 patients. The most important risk factors for extubation failure were ventilatory characteristics, indicators of inflammation, the Glasgow Coma Scale, and body mass index. They are recognized clinically for their importance in predicting sepsis onset.

The second application in Chapter 7 describes the risk factors for mortality, ICU-free days and ventilator free days in COVID-19 patients. We found that the strongest predictor of mortality in critically-ill COVID-19 patients was age. Similar to Chapter 6, we identified clinical factors that require monitoring and capturing in the EHR as they were strongly associated to patient outcomes, relative to the other parameters in the model. These factors include clinical parameters not typically present in registry datasets, such as pH, P/F ratio and driving pressure. Overall, the clinical parameters most associated with adverse outcomes may easily be recorded in EHRs and are familiar to ICU clinicians.

In Part IV, we outline our implementation of clinical decision support software in clinical practice. Clinical implementation is one of the central hurdles in critical care machine learning. Chapter 8 describes the use case for clinical decision support to guide antibiotic dosing in critically-ill patients. We performed a cross-sectional survey study to assess pharmacokinetic knowledge among intensive care clinicians. Pass rates of the test were below 50% for intensivists, intensive care fellows, residents and ICU nurses. These results demonstrate the need for aiding clinicians in pharmacokinetic guided antibiotic dosing.

In Chapter 9 and 10 we describe the clinical implementation of AutoKinetics, a computerized dosing advice software for four antibiotics. The software provides continuous and real-time dosing advice to clinicians at the intensive care bedside. We show that with AutoKinetics, real-time, continuous clinical decision support is feasible at the ICU bedside and can be integrated into the clinical workflow.</jats:p>

AB  - Price forecasting is at the center of decision making in electricity markets. Much research has been done in forecasting energy prices for a single market while little research has been reported on forecasting price difference between markets, which presents higher volatility and yet plays a critical role in applications such as virtual trading. To this end, this paper takes the first attempt at it and employs novel deep learning architecture with Bidirectional Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) units and Sequence-to-Sequence (Seq2Seq) architecture to forecast nodal price difference between day-ahead and real-time markets. In addition to value prediction, these deep learning architectures are also used to develop classification models to predict the price difference bands/ranges. The proposed methods are tested using historical PJM market data, and evaluated using Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and other customized performance metrics. Case studies show that both deep learning methods outperform common methods including ARIMA, XGBoost and Support Vector Regression (SVR) methods. More importantly, the deep learning methods can capture the magnitude and timing of price difference spikes. Numerical results show the Seq2Seq model performs particularly well and demonstrates generalization capability to extended forecasting lead time.

AB  - We present further study of a subset of carbapenems, arising from a previously reported machine learning approach, with regard to their mouse pharmacokinetic profiling and subsequent study in a mouse model of sub-acute Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. Pharmacokinetic metrics for such small molecules were compared to those for meropenem and biapenem, resulting in the selection of two carbapenems to be assessed for their ability to reduce M. tuberculosis bacterial loads in the lungs of infected mice. The original syntheses of these two carbapenems were optimized to provide multigram quantities of each compound. One of the two experimental carbapenems, JSF-2204, exhibited efficacy equivalent to that of meropenem, while both were inferior to rifampin. The lessons learned in this study point toward the need to further enhance the pharmacokinetic profiles of experimental carbapenems to positively impact in vivo efficacy performance.

AB  - <jats:p>Artificial intelligence recognition of human actions has been used in various fields. This article is based on deep learning and improved dynamic time regularization algorithms to study football action postures. This paper proposes a hierarchical recurrent network for understanding team sports activities in image and position sequences. In the hierarchical model, this article integrates the proposed multiple human-centered features on the time series based on LSTM output. In order to realize this scheme, the holding state is introduced as one of the external controllable states in LSTM, and the hierarchical LSTM is extended to include the integration mechanism. Test outcomes demonstrate those adequacies of the recommended framework, which includes progressive LSTM human-centred benefits. In this study, the improvement of the reference model in the two-stream LSTM-based method is shown. Specifically, by combining human-centered features and meta-information (e.g., location data) into the postfusion framework proposed in the article, the article also proves that the action categories have increased, and the observations enhanced the robustness of fluctuations in the number of football players. The experimental data shows that 67.89% of the postures of football players through this algorithm can be recognized by the improved dynamic time warping algorithm.</jats:p>

AB  - The large volume and suboptimal image quality of portable chest X-rays (CXRs) as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic could post significant challenges for radiologists and frontline physicians. Deep-learning artificial intelligent (AI) methods have the potential to help improve diagnostic efficiency and accuracy for reading portable CXRs. The study aimed at developing an AI imaging analysis tool to classify COVID-19 lung infection based on portable CXRs. Public datasets of COVID-19 (N = 130), bacterial pneumonia (N = 145), non-COVID-19 viral pneumonia (N = 145), and normal (N = 138) CXRs were analyzed. Texture and morphological features were extracted. Five supervised machine-learning AI algorithms were used to classify COVID-19 from other conditions. Two-class and multi-class classification were performed. Statistical analysis was done using unpaired two-tailed t tests with unequal variance between groups. Performance of classification models used the receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. For the two-class classification, the accuracy, sensitivity and specificity were, respectively, 100%, 100%, and 100% for COVID-19 vs normal; 96.34%, 95.35% and 97.44% for COVID-19 vs bacterial pneumonia; and 97.56%, 97.44% and 97.67% for COVID-19 vs non-COVID-19 viral pneumonia. For the multi-class classification, the combined accuracy and AUC were 79.52% and 0.87, respectively. AI classification of texture and morphological features of portable CXRs accurately distinguishes COVID-19 lung infection in patients in multi-class datasets. Deep-learning methods have the potential to improve diagnostic efficiency and accuracy for portable CXRs.

Based on field-theoretic arguments, certain moments of the groomed jet radius <jats:italic>R</jats:italic><jats:sub><jats:italic>g</jats:italic></jats:sub> capture the entirety of the kinematic and grooming parameter dependence of these effects. These moments can be computed perturbatively in the soft drop operator expansion region where these corrections are small, but yet significant to be relevant for precision physics. A precise determination of these moments is thus crucial to faithfully isolate the universal contributions of hadronization and the underlying event. Building on a previously developed effective field theory framework for the doubly differential soft drop groomed jet mass and groomed jet radius measurement, we present here a calculation of these moments at next-to-next-to-leading-logarithmic (NNLL) accuracy including matching into the plain jet mass region. We compare our predictions for these moments against parton-shower Monte Carlo simulations and find good agreement. These results have applications for precision physics with soft drop jet mass such as determination of the strong coupling constant and the top quark mass and for improving hadronization models.</jats:p>

AB  - Due to the rapid growth of the Internet of Things (IoT), applications such as the Augmented Reality (AR)/Virtual Reality (VR), higher resolution media stream, automatic vehicle driving, the smart environment and intelligent e-health applications, increasing demands for high data rates, high bandwidth, low latency, and the quality of services are increasing every day (QoS). The management of network resources for IoT service provisioning is a major issue in modern communication. A possible solution to this issue is the use of the integrated fiber-wireless (FiWi) access network. In addition, dynamic and efficient network configurations can be achieved through software-defined networking (SDN), an innovative and programmable networking architecture enabling machine learning (ML) to automate networks. This paper, we propose a machine learning supervised network traffic classification scheduling model in SDN enhanced-FiWi-IoT that can intelligently learn and guarantee traffic based on its QoS requirements (QoS-Mapping). We capture the different IoT and non-IoT device network traffic trace files based on the traffic flow and analyze the traffic traces to extract statistical attributes (port source and destination, IP address, etc.). We develop a robust IoT device classification process module framework, using these network-level attributes to classify IoT and non-IoT devices. We tested the proposed classification process module in 21 IoT/Non-IoT devices with different ML algorithms and the results showed that classification can achieve a Random Forest classifier with 99% accuracy as compared to other techniques.

AB  - Machine learning applied to financial transaction records can predict how likely a small business is to repay a loan. For this purpose we compared a traditional scorecard credit risk model against various machine learning models and found that XGBoost with monotonic constraints outperformed scorecard model by 7% in K-S statistic. To deploy such a machine learning model in production for loan application risk scoring it must comply with lending industry regulations that require lenders to provide understandable and specific reasons for credit decisions. Thus we also developed a loan decision explanation technique based on the ideas of WoE and SHAP. Our research was carried out using a historical dataset of tens of thousands of loans and millions of associated financial transactions. The credit risk scoring model based on XGBoost with monotonic constraints and SHAP explanations described in this paper have been deployed by QuickBooks Capital to assess incoming loan applications since July 2019.

                     </jats:title><jats:p>In gauge/gravity duality, matrix degrees of freedom on the gauge theory side play important roles for the emergent geometry. In this paper, we discuss how the entanglement on the gravity side can be described as the entanglement between matrix degrees of freedom. Our approach, which we call ‘matrix entanglement’, is different from ‘target-space entanglement’ proposed and discussed recently by several groups. We consider several classes of quantum states to which our approach can play important roles. When applied to fuzzy sphere, matrix entanglement can be used to define the usual spatial entanglement in two-brane or five-brane world-volume theory nonperturbatively in a regularized setup. Another application is to a small black hole in AdS<jats:sub>5</jats:sub>×S<jats:sup>5</jats:sup> that can evaporate without being attached to a heat bath, for which our approach suggests a gauge theory origin of the Page curve. The confined degrees of freedom in the partially-deconfined states play the important roles.</jats:p>

AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>The Pandora Software Development Kit and algorithm libraries provide pattern-recognition logic essential to the reconstruction of particle interactions in liquid argon time projection chamber detectors. Pandora is the primary event reconstruction software used at ProtoDUNE-SP, a prototype for the Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment far detector. ProtoDUNE-SP, located at CERN, is exposed to a charged-particle test beam. This paper gives an overview of the Pandora reconstruction algorithms and how they have been tailored for use at ProtoDUNE-SP. In complex events with numerous cosmic-ray and beam background particles, the simulated reconstruction and identification efficiency for triggered test-beam particles is above 80% for the majority of particle type and beam momentum combinations. Specifically, simulated 1 GeV/<jats:italic>c</jats:italic> charged pions and protons are correctly reconstructed and identified with efficiencies of 86.1<jats:inline-formula><jats:alternatives><jats:tex-math>$$\pm 0.6$$</jats:tex-math><mml:math xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">

AB  - Configuration tuning is vital to optimize the performance of a database management system (DBMS). It becomes more tedious and urgent for cloud databases (CDB) due to diverse database instances and query workloads, which make the job of a database administrator (DBA) very difficult. Existing solutions for automatic DBMS configuration tuning have several limitations. Firstly, they adopt a pipelined learning model but cannot optimize the overall performance in an end-to-end manner. Secondly, they rely on large-scale high-quality training samples which are hard to obtain. Thirdly, existing approaches cannot recommend reasonable configurations for a large number of knobs to tune whose potential values live in such high-dimensional continuous space. Lastly, in cloud environments, existing approaches can hardly cope with the changes of hardware configurations and workloads, and have poor adaptability. To address these challenges, we design an end-to-end automatic CDB tuning system, $${\texttt {CDBTune}}^{+}$$
 , using deep reinforcement learning (RL). $${\texttt {CDBTune}}^{+}$$
 utilizes the deep deterministic policy gradient method to find the optimal configurations in a high-dimensional continuous space. $${\texttt {CDBTune}}^{+}$$
 adopts a trial-and-error strategy to learn knob settings with a limited number of samples to accomplish the initial training, which alleviates the necessity of collecting a massive amount of high-quality samples. $${\texttt {CDBTune}}^{+}$$
 adopts the reward-feedback mechanism in RL instead of traditional regression, which enables end-to-end learning and accelerates the convergence speed of our model and improves the efficiency of online tuning. Besides, we propose effective techniques to improve the training and tuning efficiency of $${\texttt {CDBTune}}^{+}$$
 for practical usage in a cloud environment. We conducted extensive experiments under 7 different workloads on real cloud databases to evaluate $${\texttt {CDBTune}}^{+}$$
 . Experimental results showed that $${\texttt {CDBTune}}^{+}$$
 adapts well to a new hardware environment or workload, and significantly outperformed the state-of-the-art tuning tools and DBA experts.

AB  - Gravitational waves provide a unique tool for observational astronomy. While the first LIGO–Virgo catalogue of gravitational-wave transients (GWTC-1) contains 11 signals from black hole and neutron star binaries, the number of observations is increasing rapidly as detector sensitivity improves. To extract information from the observed signals, it is imperative to have fast, flexible, and scalable inference techniques. In a previous paper, we introduced bilby: a modular and user-friendly Bayesian inference library adapted to address the needs of gravitational-wave inference. In this work, we demonstrate that bilby produces reliable results for simulated gravitational-wave signals from compact binary mergers, and verify that it accurately reproduces results reported for the 11 GWTC-1 signals. Additionally, we provide configuration and output files for all analyses to allow for easy reproduction, modification, and future use. This work establishes that bilby is primed and ready to analyse the rapidly growing population of compact binary coalescence gravitational-wave signals.

AB  - <jats:p>Erosion can have a negative impact on the agricultural sustainability and grazing lands in the Mediterranean area, especially in northern Algeria. It is useful to map the spatial occurrence of erosion and identify susceptible erodible areas on large scale. The main objective of this research was to compare the performance of four machine learning techniques: Categorical boosting, Adaptive boosting, Convolutional Neural Network, and stacking ensemble models to predict the occurrence of erosion in the Macta basin, northwestern Algeria. Several climatologic, morphologic, hydrological, and geological factors based on multi-sources data were elaborated in GIS environment to determine the erosion factors in the studied area. The conditioning factors encompassing rainfall erosivity, slope, aspect, elevation, LULC, topographic wetness index, distance from river, distance from roads, clay mineral ratio, lithology, and geology were derived via the integration of topographic attributes and remote sensing data including Landsat 8 and Sentinel 2 within a GIS framework. The inventory map of soil erosion was created by integrating data from the global positioning system to locate erosion sites, conducting extensive field surveys, and analyzing satellite images obtained from Google Earth through visual interpretation. The dataset was divided randomly into two sets with 60% for training and calibrating and 40% for testing the models. Statistical metrics including sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) were used to assess the validity of the proposed models. The results revealed that machine learning and deep learning, as well stacking ensemble techniques, showed outstanding performance with accuracy over 98% with sensitivity 0.98 and specificity 0.98. Policy makers and local authorities can utilize the predicted erosion susceptibility maps to promote sustainable use of water and soil conservation and safeguard agricultural activities against potential damage.</jats:p>

AB  - We here report on the progress of the HHH Workshop, that took place in Dubrovnik in July 2023. After the discovery of a particle that complies with the properties of the Higgs boson of the Standard Model, all Standard Model (SM) parameters are in principle determined. However, in order to verify or falsify the model, the full form of the potential has to be determined. This includes the measurement of the triple and quartic scalar couplings. We here report on ongoing progress of measurements for multi-scalar final states, with an emphasis on three SM-like scalar bosons at 125 <mml:math xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mml:mrow><mml:mspace/> <mml:mtext>Ge</mml:mtext> <mml:mspace/> <mml:mtext>V</mml:mtext></mml:mrow> </mml:math> , but also mentioning other options. We discuss both experimental progress and challenges as well as theoretical studies and models that can enhance such rates with respect to the SM predictions.

AB  - <jats:p>Option pricing based on data-driven methods is a challenging task that has attracted much attention recently. There are mainly two types of methods that have been widely used, respectively, the neural network method and the ensemble learning method. The option pricing model based on the neural network has high complexity, and a large number of hyper-parameters will be generated during training, resulting in difficult model adjustment. Furthermore, a lot of training data are needed. The option pricing model based on ensemble learning is not ideal for data feature extraction, because each calculation of the ensemble learning method is mainly to reduce the final residual. Therefore, this paper adopts a learning framework that embeds the modular ensemble learning methods into the network learning structure, and an option pricing model based on deep ensemble learning is proposed. The model is mainly composed of two parts: features reorganization based on random forest, used to calculate the importance of features, combined with the original data as training input; the multilayer ensemble data training structure is based on network learning structure and embeds two ensemble learning methods as network modules, and it also designs a stop algorithm to automatically determine the number of layers. This enables the model to retain the effect of data feature extraction and adapt to small and medium data sets without generating many hyper-parameters. Moreover, in order to make the model fully absorb the advantages of the two ensemble learning methods, we adopt cross-training for data. From the experimental results, it can be concluded that compared with the current optimal method, the prediction performance of the proposed model is improved by 36% in the root mean square error (RMSE), which proves the superiority of the proposed model from the quantitative direction.</jats:p>

AB  - This thesis attempts to understand and predict software developer expertise based on their activity and experience on GitHub and Stack Overflow platforms. An exploratory survey was conducted with 73 software developers and a mixed methods approach was applied to analyze the survey results. Further, using Machine Learning techniques the thesis attempts to predict software developer expertise based on their participation on social coding platforms. The thesis found that both knowledge and experience are only necessary but not sufficient conditions for a developer to become an expert, and an expert would necessarily have to possess adequate soft skills. Lastly, an expert's contribution to GitHub seems to be driven by personal factors, while contribution to Stack Overflow is motivated more by professional drivers (i.e., skills and expertise). The last section determined the best predicting classifier-algorithm for contributors, understood the distribution of expertise and their characteristics and compared prediction capability of the model.

The STCF project in China is under development with an extensive R&amp;D program. This document presents the physics opportunities at the STCF, describes conceptual designs of the STCF detector system, and discusses future plans for detector R&amp;D and physics case studies.</jats:p>

AB  - The Internet of Things (IoT) is a new future technology that is aimed at connecting billions of physical-world objects to the IT infrastructure via a wireless medium. Many radio access technologies exist, but few address the requirements of IoT applications such as low cost, low energy consumption, and long range. Low-Power wide-area network (LPWAN) technologies, especially SigFox, have a low data rate that makes them suitable for IoT applications, especially since the lower the data rate, the longer the usable distance for the radio link. SigFox technology achieves as a main objective network reliability by striving for the successful delivery of data messages through redundancy. Doing so results in one of the SigFox weaknesses, namely the high collision rate, which questions SigFox scalability. In this work, we aimed at avoiding collisions by changing SigFox's Aloha-based medium access protocol to TDMA and by using only orthogonal channels while removing redundancy. Consequently, every node sends a single copy of the data message on a given orthogonal channel in a specific time slot. To achieve this, we implemented a slot- and channel-allocation protocol (SCAP) on top of SigFox. In other words, our goal was to improve SigFox's scalability by implementing two mechanisms: time slot allocation and channel allocation. Performance analysis was conducted on large networks with sizes ranging from 1000 to 10,000 nodes to evaluate both technologies: the original SigFox and SCAP SigFox. The simulation results showed that SCAP SigFox highly reduced the probability of collision and energy consumption when compared to the original SigFox. Additionally, SCAP SigFox had a greater throughput and packet delivery ratio (PDR).

AB  - Objectives: Deep learning methods have achieved impressive diagnostic performance in the field of radiology. The current study aimed to use deep learning methods to detect caries lesions, classify different radiographic extensions on panoramic films, and compare the classification results with those of expert dentists. Methods: A total of 1160 dental panoramic films were evaluated by three expert dentists. All caries lesions in the films were marked with circles, whose combination was defined as the reference dataset. A training and validation dataset (1071) and a test dataset (89) were then established from the reference dataset. A convolutional neural network, called nnU-Net, was applied to detect caries lesions, and DenseNet121 was applied to classify the lesions according to their depths (dentin lesions in the outer, middle, or inner third D1/2/3 of dentin). The performance of the test dataset in the trained nnU-Net and DenseNet121 models was compared with the results of six expert dentists in terms of the intersection over union (IoU), Dice coefficient, accuracy, precision, recall, negative predictive value (NPV), and F1-score metrics. Results: nnU-Net yielded caries lesion segmentation IoU and Dice coefficient values of 0.785 and 0.663, respectively, and the accuracy and recall rate of nnU-Net were 0.986 and 0.821, respectively. The results of the expert dentists and the neural network were shown to be no different in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, NPV, and F1-score. For caries depth classification, DenseNet121 showed an overall accuracy of 0.957 for D1 lesions, 0.832 for D2 lesions, and 0.863 for D3 lesions. The recall results of the D1/D2/D3 lesions were 0.765, 0.652, and 0.918, respectively. All metric values, including accuracy, precision, recall, NPV, and F1-score values, were proven to be no different from those of the experienced dentists. Conclusion: In detecting and classifying caries lesions on dental panoramic radiographs, the performance of deep learning methods was similar to that of expert dentists. The impact of applying these well-trained neural networks for disease diagnosis and treatment decision making should be explored.

        <jats:p>In the modern era of technologies, the internet grows in the advancement of our day-to-day life like automation devices. The devices to set up industries with integrated cyber-physical systems and industrial IoT applications. Generative adversarial networks (GAN) can generate Cognitive feedback analysis with various data for both generator and discriminator in a supervised model. Neural networks are used for artificial intelligence algorithms, but in adversarial networks, feedback analytics is analyzed with the significance of data. The modern age of intelligent manufacturing will indeed be ushered in by Cyber-Physical Production Systems (CPPS). However, because of the connections between the virtual and physical worlds, CPPS would be subject to cross-domain assaults. Against Denial-of-Service (DoS) threats, this paper concentrates on complex performance feedback management of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). To begin, a swapping system modelling approach for the complex response feedback CPS is provided by analyzing the distinct effects of DoS assaults on the sensor-controller (S-C) and controller-to-actuator (C-A) channels, accordingly. Given the difference in bandwidth between the dual channels and the accused's energy cap, it is reasonable to conclude that an offender can only jam a single communication stream at a point and also that the possible number of successive DoS attacks is limited. Second, using a packet-based transfer scheme, a nested switching paradigm is built on the foundation of the switching mechanism, considering both the spatial heterogeneity and the temporal durability of DoS attacks. The probability of discriminator gets analyzed feedback data to check whether actual data or fake data is sampled, and it is generated. Cognitive feedback supports genetic algorithms to sample the feedback data in a system for advanced technologies.</jats:p>

AB  - The expected possession value (EPV) of a soccer possession represents the likelihood of a team scoring or conceding the next goal at any time instance. In this work, we develop a comprehensive analysis framework for the EPV, providing soccer practitioners with the ability to evaluate the impact of observed and potential actions, both visually and analytically. The EPV expression is decomposed into a series of subcomponents that model the influence of passes, ball drives and shot actions on the expected outcome of a possession. We show we can learn from spatiotemporal tracking data and obtain calibrated models for all the components of the EPV. For the components related with passes, we produce visually-interpretable probability surfaces from a series of deep neural network architectures built on top of flexible representations of game states. Additionally, we present a series of novel practical applications providing coaches with an enriched interpretation of specific game situations. This is, to our knowledge, the first EPV approach in soccer that uses this decomposition and incorporates the dynamics of the 22 players and the ball through tracking data.

AB  - Traffic accidents are one of the most important concerns of the world, since they result in numerous casualties, injuries, and fatalities each year, as well as significant economic losses. There are many factors that are responsible for causing road accidents. If these factors can be better understood and predicted, it might be possible to take measures to mitigate the damages and its severity. The purpose of this work is to identify these factors using accident data from 2016 to 2019 from the district of Setubal, Portugal. This work aims at developing models that can select a set of influential factors that may be used to classify the severity of an accident, supporting an analysis on the accident data. In addition, this study also proposes a predictive model for future road accidents based on past data. Various machine learning approaches are used to create these models. Supervised machine learning methods such as decision trees (DT), random forests (RF), logistic regression (LR), and naive Bayes (NB) are used, as well as unsupervised machine learning techniques including DBSCAN and hierarchical clustering. Results show that a rule-based model using the C5.0 algorithm is capable of accurately detecting the most relevant factors describing a road accident severity. Further, the results of the predictive model suggests the RF model could be a useful tool for forecasting accident hotspots.

AB  - This paper describes some of the challenges that need to be addressed in order to develop collaborative spectrum-sharing systems. The importance of these challenges stems from the assumption that rules for spectrum sharing can change after the deployment of radio networks and that the whole system must be able to adapt to them. To address such a requirement, we used a policy-based approach in which transmissions are controlled by a policy interpreter system, and the policies can be modified during system operation. Our primary goal was to develop a prototype of such a system. In this paper, we outline the implementation of policy interpretation, automatic generation of transmission opportunities in case a request for transmission is denied by the policy reasoner, and the generation of rendezvous channels for the synchronization of otherwise asynchronously running software-defined radios.

AB  - Eating, central to human existence, is influenced by a myriad of factors, including nutrition, health, personal taste, cultural background, and flavor preferences. The challenge of devising personalized meal plans that effectively encompass these dimensions is formidable. A crucial shortfall in many existing meal-planning systems is poor user adherence, often stemming from a disconnect between the plan and the user's lifestyle, preferences, or unseen eating patterns. Our study introduces a pioneering algorithm, CFRL, which melds reinforcement learning (RL) with collaborative filtering (CF) in a unique synergy. This algorithm not only addresses nutritional and health considerations but also dynamically adapts to and uncovers latent user eating habits, thereby significantly enhancing user acceptance and adherence. CFRL utilizes Markov decision processes (MDPs) for interactive meal recommendations and incorporates a CF-based MDP framework to align with broader user preferences, translated into a shared latent vector space. Central to CFRL is its innovative reward-shaping mechanism, rooted in multi-criteria decision-making that includes user ratings, preferences, and nutritional data. This results in versatile, user-specific meal plans. Our comparative analysis with four baseline methods showcases CFRL's superior performance in key metrics like user satisfaction and nutritional adequacy. This research underscores the effectiveness of combining RL and CF in personalized meal planning, marking a substantial advancement over traditional approaches.

AB  - Drought is a fundamental physical feature of the climate pattern worldwide. Over the past few decades, a natural disaster has accelerated its occurrence, which has significantly impacted agricultural systems, economies, environments, water resources, and supplies. Therefore, it is essential to develop new techniques that enable comprehensive determination and observations of droughts over large areas with satisfactory spatial and temporal resolution. This study modeled a new drought index called the Combined Terrestrial Evapotranspiration Index (CTEI), developed in the Ganga river basin. For this, five Machine Learning (ML) techniques, derived from artificial intelligence theories, were applied: the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm, decision trees, Matern 5/2 Gaussian process regression, boosted trees, and bagged trees. These techniques were driven by twelve different models generated from input combinations of satellite data and hydrometeorological parameters. The results indicated that the eighth model performed best and was superior among all the models, with the SVM algorithm resulting in an R2 value of 0.82 and the lowest errors in terms of the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) (0.33) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) (0.20), followed by the Matern 5/2 Gaussian model with an R2 value of 0.75 and RMSE and MAE of 0.39 and 0.21 mm/day, respectively. Moreover, among all the five methods, the SVM and Matern 5/2 Gaussian methods were the best-performing ML algorithms in our study of CTEI predictions for the Ganga basin.

AB  - The recent outbreak of SARS COV-2 gave us a unique opportunity to study for a non interventional and sustainable AI solution. Lung disease remains a major healthcare challenge with high morbidity and mortality worldwide. The predominant lung disease was lung cancer. Until recently, the world has witnessed the global pandemic of COVID19, the Novel coronavirus outbreak. We have experienced how viral infection of lung and heart claimed thousands of lives worldwide. With the unprecedented advancement of Artificial Intelligence in recent years, Machine learning can be used to easily detect and classify medical imagery. It is much faster and most of the time more accurate than human radiologists. Once implemented, it is more cost-effective and time-saving. In our study, we evaluated the efficacy of Microsoft Cognitive Service to detect and classify COVID19 induced pneumonia from other Viral/Bacterial pneumonia based on X-Ray and CT images. We wanted to assess the implication and accuracy of the Automated ML-based Rapid Application Development (RAD) environment in the field of Medical Image diagnosis. This study will better equip us to respond with an ML-based diagnostic Decision Support System(DSS) for a Pandemic situation like COVID19. After optimization, the trained network achieved 96.8% Average Precision which was implemented as a Web Application for consumption. However, the same trained network did not perform the same like Web Application when ported to Smartphone for Real-time inference. Which was our main interest of study. The authors believe, there is scope for further study on this issue. One of the main goal of this study was to develop and evaluate the performance of AI-powered Smartphone-based Real-time Application. Facilitating primary diagnostic services in less equipped and understaffed rural healthcare centers of the world with unreliable internet service.

AB  - Persistent organic pollutants (POPs) are highly toxic and difficult to degrade in the natural ecology, which has a severe negative impact on the ecological environment. Quantifying changes in the concentrations of persistent organic pollutants in the Great Lakes is challenging work. Machine learning (ML) methods are potent predictors that have recently achieved impressive performance on time series tasks. ARIMA model, Linear Regression methods, XGBoost algorithm, and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) are commonly used for estimating time-series changes. Traditionally Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) have been standard criteria to measure the error between the actual value and predicted value; however, Euclidean distance (ED) cannot effectively calculate the similarity between two-time series. We proposed an alternative criterion called Penalty Dynamic Time Wrapping (Penalty-DTW) based on Dynamic Time Wrapping (DTW). It can accurately measure the difference between the actual value and the predicted value. We study the benefits of Penalty-DTW vs. ED under the above ML algorithms. Further, considering the machine learning algorithm’s uncertainty, we proposed combining LSTM and deep ensemble methods to quantify algorithms uncertainty and make a confident prediction. We find improved LSTM model outperformed other predictive power models by comparing pollutant concentration prediction. The prediction results show that the concentration of pollutants has a stable downward trend in recent years. Simultaneously, we found that pollutants’ concentration correlates with seasons, which positively guides environmental pollution control in the Great Lakes.

AB  - Amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques and tau protein tangles in the brain are now widely recognized as the defining hallmarks of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), followed by structural atrophy detectable on brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. One of the particular neurodegenerative regions is the hippocampus to which the influence of Aβ/tau on has been one of the research focuses in the AD pathophysiological progress. This work proposes a novel framework, Federated Morphometry Feature Selection (FMFS) model, to examine subtle aspects of hippocampal morphometry that are associated with Aβ/tau burden in the brain, measured using positron emission tomography (PET). FMFS is comprised of hippocampal surface-based feature calculation, patch-based feature selection, federated group LASSO regression, federated screening rule-based stability selection, and region of interest (ROI) identification. FMFS was tested on two ADNI cohorts to understand hippocampal alterations that relate to Aβ/tau depositions. Each cohort included pairs of MRI and PET for AD, mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and cognitively unimpaired (CU) subjects. Experimental results demonstrated that FMFS achieves an 89x speedup compared to other published state-of-the-art methods under five independent hypothetical institutions. In addition, the subiculum and cornu ammonis 1 (CA1 subfield) were identified as hippocampal subregions where atrophy is strongly associated with abnormal Aβ/tau. As potential biomarkers for Aβ/tau pathology, the features from the identified ROIs had greater power for predicting cognitive assessment and for survival analysis than five other imaging biomarkers. All the results indicate that FMFS is an efficient and effective tool to reveal associations between Aβ/tau burden and hippocampal morphometry.

AB  - <jats:p>Energy is one of the most fundamental elements of today’s economy. It is becoming more important day by day with technological developments. In order to plan the energy policies of the countries and to prevent the climate change crisis, CO2 emissions must be under control. For this reason, the estimation of CO2 emissions has become an important factor for researchers and scientists. In this study, a new hybrid method was developed using optimization methods. The Shuffled Frog-Leaping Algorithm (SFLA) algorithm has recently become the preferred method for solving many optimization problems. SFLA, a swarm-based heuristic method, was developed in this study using the Levy flight method. Thus, the speed of reaching the optimum result of the algorithm has been improved. This method, which was developed later, was used in a hybrid structure of the Firefly Algorithm (FA). In the next step, a new Artificial Neural Network (ANN)-based estimation method is proposed using the hybrid optimization method. The method was used to estimate the amount of CO2 emissions in Türkiye. The proposed hybrid model had the RMSE error 5.1107 and the R2 0.9904 for a testing dataset, respectively. In the last stage, Türkiye’s future CO2 emission estimation is examined in three different scenarios. The obtained results show that the proposed estimation method can be successfully applied in areas requiring future estimation.</jats:p>

AB  - Serological methods serve as a direct or indirect means of pathogen infection diagnosis in plant and animal species, including humans. Dot-ELISA (DE) is an inexpensive and sensitive, solid-state version of the microplate enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, with a broad range of applications in epidemiology. Yet, its applicability is limited by uncertainties in the qualitative output of the assay due to overlapping dot colorations of positive and negative samples, stemming mainly from the inherent color discrimination thresholds of the human eye. Here, we report a novel approach for unambiguous DE output evaluation by applying machine learning-based pattern recognition of image pixels of the blot using an impartial predictive model rather than human judgment. Supervised machine learning was used to train a classifier algorithm through a built multivariate logistic regression model based on the RGB (9Red9, 9Green9, 9Blue9) pixel attributes of a scanned DE output of samples of known infection status to a model pathogen (Lettuce big-vein associated virus). Based on the trained and cross-validated algorithm, pixel probabilities of unknown samples could be predicted in scanned DE output images which would then be reconstituted by pixels having probabilities above a cutoff that may be selected at will to yield desirable false positive and false negative rates depending on the question at hand, thus allowing for proper dot classification of positive and negative samples and, hence, accurate diagnosis. Potential improvements and diagnostic applications of the proposed versatile method that translates unique pathogen antigens to the universal basic color language are discussed.

AB  - Expected goals of a football match determine whether a team have won or lost.When considering the expected goal results, a team may appear to have lost the game but actually win it, and vice versa.The expected goal is the amount of goals a team should have scored based on the information available for that particular game.Numerous machine learning algorithms are employed to measure the effectiveness of shots in football.In this paper, we develop a gradient Boosting model to evaluate the scoring opportunities using event data collected from live football matches.This method can be used to show the players who are most likely to score at any given time throughout the game as well as where on the field they are most likely to do so.Experimental results demonstrate that they recognise and assess significant match opportunities and analyze the players in a football match depending upon their performance using Expected goals(xG) as an evaluation metric.

AB  - <jats:p>Current domain-independent, classical planners require symbolic models of the problem domain and instance as input, resulting in a knowledge acquisition bottleneck. Meanwhile, although deep learning has achieved significant success in many fields, the knowledge is encoded in a subsymbolic representation which is incompatible with symbolic systems such as planners. We propose Latplan, an unsupervised architecture combining deep learning and classical planning. Given only an unlabeled set of image pairs showing a subset of transitions allowed in the environment (training inputs), Latplan learns a complete propositional PDDL action model of the environment. Later, when a pair of images representing the initial and the goal states (planning inputs) is given, Latplan finds a plan to the goal state in a symbolic latent space and returns a visualized plan execution. We evaluate Latplan using image-based versions of 6 planning domains: 8-puzzle, 15-Puzzle, Blocksworld, Sokoban and Two variations of LightsOut.</jats:p>

AB  - To successfully operate online games, gaming companies are introducing the systematic customer relationship management model. Particularly, churn analysis is one of the most important issues, because preventing a customer from churning is often more cost-efficient than acquiring a new customer. Churn prediction models should, thus, consider maximizing not only accuracy but also the expected profit derived from the churn prevention. We, thus, propose a churn prediction method for optimizing profit consisting of two main steps: first, selecting prediction target, second, tuning threshold of the model. In online games, the distribution of a user's customer lifetime value is very biased that a few users contribute to most of the sales, and most of the churners are no-paying users. Consequently, it is cost-effective to focus on churn prediction to loyal customers who have sufficient benefits. Furthermore, it is more profitable to adjust the threshold of the prediction model so that the expected profit is maximized rather than maximizing the accuracy. We applied the proposed method to real-world online game service, Aion, one of the most popular online games in South Korea, and then show that our method has more cost-effectiveness than the prediction model for total users when the campaign cost and the conversion rate are considered.

AB  - <jats:p>The evaluation of structural response constitutes a fundamental task in the design of ground-excited structures. In this context, the Monte Carlo simulation is a powerful tool to estimate the response statistics of nonlinear systems, which cannot be represented analytically. Unfortunately, the number of samples which is required for estimations with high confidence increases disproportionally to obtain a reliable estimation of low-probability events. As a consequence, the Monte Carlo simulation becomes a non-realizable task from a computational perspective. We show that the application of machine learning algorithms significantly lowers the computational burden of the Monte Carlo method. We use artificial neural networks to predict structural response behavior using supervised learning. However, one shortcoming of supervised learning is the inability of a sufficiently accurate prediction when extrapolating to data the neural network has not seen yet. In this paper, neural networks predict the response of structures subjected to non-stationary ground excitations. In doing so, we propose a novel selection process for the training data to provide the required samples to reliably predict rare events. We, finally, prove that the new strategy results in a significant improvement of the prediction of the response statistics in the tail end of the distribution.</jats:p>

AB  - <AbstractText Label="BACKGROUND">Rooted phylogenetic networks are used to display complex evolutionary history involving so-called reticulation events, such as genetic recombination. Various methods have been developed to construct such networks, using for example a multiple sequence alignment or multiple phylogenetic trees as input data. Coronaviruses are known to recombine frequently, but rooted phylogenetic networks have not yet been used extensively to describe their evolutionary history. Here, we created a workflow to compare the evolutionary history of SARS-CoV-2 with other SARS-like viruses using several rooted phylogenetic network inference algorithms. This workflow includes filtering noise from sets of phylogenetic trees by contracting edges based on branch length and bootstrap support, followed by resolution of multifurcations. We explored the running times of the network inference algorithms, the impact of filtering on the properties of the produced networks, and attempted to derive biological insights regarding the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 from them.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="RESULTS">The network inference algorithms are capable of constructing rooted phylogenetic networks for coronavirus data, although running-time limitations require restricting such datasets to a relatively small number of taxa. Filtering generally reduces the number of reticulations in the produced networks and increases their temporal consistency. Taxon bat-SL-CoVZC45 emerges as a major and structural source of discordance in the dataset. The tested algorithms often indicate that SARS-CoV-2/RaTG13 is a tree-like clade, with possibly some reticulate activity further back in their history. A smaller number of constructed networks posit SARS-CoV-2 as a possible recombinant, although this might be a methodological artefact arising from the interaction of bat-SL-CoVZC45 discordance and the optimization criteria used.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="CONCLUSION">Our results demonstrate that as part of a wider workflow and with careful attention paid to running time, rooted phylogenetic network algorithms are capable of producing plausible networks from coronavirus data. These networks partly corroborate existing theories about SARS-CoV-2, and partly produce new avenues for exploration regarding the location and significance of reticulate activity within the wider group of SARS-like viruses. Our workflow may serve as a model for pipelines in which phylogenetic network algorithms can be used to analyse different datasets and test different hypotheses.</AbstractText>

AB  - <jats:p>Abstract: As we all know that due to this pandemic situation many problems had been faced in the education stream. As we saw that the most of the students got good marks and on the other hand most students got lesser or average marks. In Critical case the good students got average marks or lesser then there expectations. As a result, all students got the admission but if the person is not that capable but taking admission to that college due to good result .So it seems unfair so to resolve this loophole, we decided to build a software for student performance prediction. It is an important desire in most of the educational departments and institutes to predict the student’s performance. Machine Learning algorithm and descriptive datasets include school, Sex, Age, Address, Family size, P status, M education, F education, M job, F job, Reason, Guardians, Travel time, Study time, Failures, School sup, Family sup, Activities, Free time, Go out, Health, attendance. We have been considered that the prediction and classification of student performance respectively using three type of machine learning algorithms such as Random Forest, ANN, XG Boost are implemented to predict the student’s academic performance. The prediction based models are created to predict academic outcomes of student performance at the end of the year each. The analysis of demographical attributes release that they are also potential indicators of a student's academic success or failure. The results of these case study gives techniques for accurately predicting student performance, and compare the accuracy with MI algorithms Index Terms- ML and AI, ANN, Random Forest, XG Boost prediction model.

AB  - With the advent of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) empowered applications for critical applications like healthcare, the questions about liability, trust, and interpretability of their outputs are raising. The black-box nature of various DL models is a roadblock to clinical utilization. Therefore, to gain the trust of clinicians and patients, we need to provide explanations about the decisions of models. With the promise of enhancing the trust and transparency of black-box models, researchers are in the phase of maturing the field of eXplainable ML (XML). In this paper, we provided a comprehensive review of explainable and interpretable ML techniques for various healthcare applications. Along with highlighting security, safety, and robustness challenges that hinder the trustworthiness of ML, we also discussed the ethical issues arising because of the use of ML/DL for healthcare. We also describe how explainable and trustworthy ML can resolve all these ethical problems. Finally, we elaborate on the limitations of existing approaches and highlight various open research problems that require further development.

AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>
          <jats:p>Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly being used today to provide solutions to many environmental problems. This is because of AI’s capability over empirical measurement and conventional computational techniques. This work therefore aim to review publications on AI applications in environmental research field. Literature was search for in Scopus database using Boolean-keyword operators. Among others, the study objectives include identifying evolution of the publications on AI within environmental research domain; their research themes and trends. Mixed-methods (qualitative and quantitative analysis) was adopted for the study, and they comprise bibliometric, text-mining and content analysis. 797 suitable publications were included in the study. Result shows 83% of the included publications in our dataset were published between 2018 and 2024. By checking through authors’ keywords, it appears that recent and popular research interest is being paid to areas such as industry 4.0, smart cities, thermal comfort, circular economy, environmental monitoring, carbon emissions and others. Text-mining of the dataset shows that most frequently used ML technique is Artificial Neural network (ANN), followed by Support Vector Machine (SVM). Text-mining also identified three major themes from the publications on AI within environmental research. They are (i) ecological decision support system (DSS), for detection, prediction and analysis of changes in ecological aspects for evidence-based decisions; (ii) sustainability transitions, illustrated by circular economy, industry 4.0, sustainable supply chains, and (iii) pollution monitoring/-***- and treatment. Eleven major research themes were also identified from bibliographic coupling of the publications within the dataset. The study results could provide a basis for future areas of interests within environmental research.</jats:p>

AB  - To respond to pandemics such as COVID-19, policy makers have relied on interventions that target specific population groups or activities. Such targeting is potentially contentious, so rigorously quantifying its benefits and downsides is critical for designing effective and equitable pandemic control policies. We propose a flexible modeling framework and a set of associated algorithms that compute optimally targeted, time-dependent interventions that coordinate across two dimensions of heterogeneity: population group characteristics and the specific activities that individuals engage in during the normal course of a day. We showcase a complete implementation in a case study focused on the Ile-de-France region of France, based on commonly available hospitalization, community mobility, social contacts and economic data. We find that optimized dual-targeted policies have a simple and explainable structure, imposing less confinement on group-activity pairs that generate a relatively high economic value prorated by activity-specific social contacts. When compared to confinements based on uniform or less granular targeting, dual-targeted policies generate substantial complementarities that lead to Pareto improvements, reducing the number of deaths and the economic losses overall and reducing the time in confinement for each population group. Since dual-targeted policies could lead to increased discrepancies in the confinements faced by distinct groups, we also quantify the impact of requirements that explicitly limit such disparities, and find that satisfactory intermediate trade-offs may be achievable through limited targeting. Significance Statement In the fight against pandemics such as COVID-19, policy makers rely on interventions that target distinct groups of individuals or activities for confinement. Such targeting can however lead to contentious policies that excessively confine certain groups like the elderly, so it is critical to understand its relative merits. We propose and implement a rigorous framework to quantify these merits and demonstrate it in a case study of COVID-19 interventions in Ile-de-France. We find that optimally designed interventions that differentiate based on both population groups and activities achieve significantly better health and economic outcomes overall and also reduce confinement time for each group, compared to less targeted interventions. The implementation, publicly available at http://insead.arnia.ro, is flexible and portable to other geographies.

AB  - Fouling in soccer has been studied from an ethical standpoint as a measure of aggression. However, there is limited research related to fouling for performance. The present study investigated fouling as a factor influencing performance in European soccer leagues. Out of possession fouls (FPGNorm), yellow cards (YCFNorm), and their ratio (YCPFPG) were used as predictors of points (Pts) and goals conceded (GA) at the end of the season using three separate linear regression models. Furthermore, 5-fold cross-validation was used to measure out sample reliability. All the models significantly predicted GA and Pts (p < 0.001). Models predicting GA showed higher reliability than models predicting points. Cross validation (CV) results suggested that FPGNorm and YCPFPG models showed a small standard deviation (SD) in the R<sup>2</sup> results whereas the results from YCFNorm were not reliable to high SD in the 5-fold CV results. In summary, FPGNorm and YCPFPG seem to predict success (low GA and high Pts) across European soccer leagues, with EPL showing the maximum effect. The findings of the current study and the methodology can be applied to an actual game analysis by coaches in multiple invasion sports. Normalizing for out of possession time is a crucial step for the time spent in particular phases of play, which has not been done in previous research while analyzing 'key performance indices' (KPIs). Normalization can successfully introduce domain-specific knowledge into predictors, which can be used in complex algorithms improving predictions and investigation of underlying mechanisms.

AB  - Cross-departmental collaboration, one of the most salient administrative reforms, has been promoted to resolve cross-jurisdictional administration issues over the previous three decades. Nearly all previous empirical studies have examined the direct impact of cross-departmental collaboration on organizational performance without accounting for the indirect effects of managerial practices. Using data from the Federal Highway Administration, this study develops an integrated structural equation modeling and Bayesian network model used to examine both direct and indirect impacts of cross-departmental collaboration on organizational performance. The structural model indicates that cross-departmental collaboration has a direct effect on organizational performance and indirect effects through its influence on resource acquisition and knowledge creation. The scenario-based simulation suggests the optimal integration of managerial actions to improve agency performance, which is achieved by encouraging cross-departmental collaboration and supporting the knowledge creation process. Finally, implications are provided to present practical managerial actions from the Federal Highway Administration as an exemplar for other highway agencies.

AB  - Many defenses have recently been proposed at venues like NIPS, ICML, ICLR and CVPR. These defenses are mainly focused on mitigating white-box attacks. They do not properly examine black-box attacks. In this paper, we expand upon the analyses of these defenses to include adaptive black-box adversaries. Our evaluation is done on nine defenses including Barrage of Random Transforms, ComDefend, Ensemble Diversity, Feature Distillation, The Odds are Odd, Error Correcting Codes, Distribution Classifier Defense, K-Winner Take All and Buffer Zones. Our investigation is done using two black-box adversarial models and six widely studied adversarial attacks for CIFAR-10 and Fashion-MNIST datasets. Our analyses show most recent defenses (7 out of 9) provide only marginal improvements in security (<25%), as compared to undefended networks. For every defense, we also show the relationship between the amount of data the adversary has at their disposal, and the effectiveness of adaptive black-box attacks. Overall, our results paint a clear picture: defenses need both thorough white-box and black-box analyses to be considered secure. We provide this large scale study and analyses to motivate the field to move towards the development of more robust black-box defenses.

AB  - Abstract We present a comprehensive statistical framework to analyze data from genome-wide association studies of polygenic traits, producing distinct and interpretable discoveries while controlling the false discovery rate. This approach leverages sophisticated multivariate models, correcting for linkage disequilibrium, and accounts for population structure and relatedness, adapting to the characteristics of the samples at hand. A key element is the recognition that the observed genotypes can be considered as a random sample from an appropriate model, encapsulating our knowledge of genetic inheritance and human populations. This allows us to generate imperfect copies (knockoffs) of these variables which serve as ideal negative controls; knockoffs are indistinguishable from the original genotypes in distribution, and independent from the phenotype. In sharp contrast with state-of-the-art methods, the validity of our inference in no way depends on assumptions about the unknown relation between genotypes and phenotype. We develop and leverage a model for the genotypes that accounts for arbitrary and unknown population structure, which may be due to diverse ancestries or familial relatedness. We build a pipeline that is robust to the most prominent possible confounders, facilitating the discovery of causal variants. Validity and effectiveness are demonstrated by extensive simulations with real data, as well as by the analysis of several phenotypes in the UK Biobank. Finally, fast software is made available for researchers to apply the proposed methodology to Biobank-scale data sets.

AB  - Polymeric materials produced from fossil fuels have been intimately linked to the development of industrial activities in the 20th century and, consequently, to the transformation of our way of living. While this has brought many benefits, the fabrication and disposal of these materials is bringing enormous sustainable challenges. Thus, materials that are produced in a more sustainable fashion and whose degradation products are harmless to the environment are urgently needed. Natural biopolymers─which can compete with and sometimes surpass the performance of synthetic polymers─provide a great source of inspiration. They are made of natural chemicals, under benign environmental conditions, and their degradation products are harmless. Before these materials can be synthetically replicated, it is essential to elucidate their chemical design and biofabrication. For protein-based materials, this means obtaining the complete sequences of the proteinaceous building blocks, a task that historically took decades of research. Thus, we start this review with a historical perspective on early efforts to obtain the primary sequences of load-bearing proteins, followed by the latest developments in sequencing and proteomic technologies that have greatly accelerated sequencing of extracellular proteins. Next, four main classes of protein materials are presented, namely fibrous materials, bioelastomers exhibiting high reversible deformability, hard bulk materials, and biological adhesives. In each class, we focus on the design at the primary and secondary structure levels and discuss their interplays with the mechanical response. We finally discuss earlier and the latest research to artificially produce protein-based materials using biotechnology and synthetic biology, including current developments by start-up companies to scale-up the production of proteinaceous materials in an economically viable manner.

AB  - Rheological properties of hydrophobized hydrolysis lignin dispersions in tank oil, diesel fuel, and industrial oil were under study. It was found that at the hydrolysis lignin content of more than 20 wt. %, a coagulation-thixotropic structure with a pseudoplastic flow pattern is formed. The parameters of structure formation calculated within the theory of elastic flocks made it possible to characterize dispersions in diesel fuel as least structured. In accordance with the theory of diffusion-limited aggregation, a computer model of the aggregate of hydrolytic lignin particles in diesel fuel was calculated and its internal structure was established using the proposed method of computer analysis of digital photographs. Machine learning was used to predict the optimal conditions for the production of mesoporous activated carbons from hydrolysis lignin. Experimentally obtained carbons are characterized by total pore volume of (0.95 ± 0.05) cm 3 /g and BET surface area of (1700 ± 85) m 2 /g, that corresponds to the predicted parameters.

AB  - <jats:p>Hate speech is an undesirable phenomenon with severe psychological and physical consequences. The emergence of mobile computing and Web 2.0 technologies has increasingly facilitated the spread of hate speech. The speed, accessibility and anonymity afforded by these tools present challenges in enforcing measures that minimise the spread of hate speech. The continued dissemination of hate speech online has triggered the development of various machine learning techniques for its automated detection. However, current approaches are inadequate because of further challenges such as the use of domain-specific language and language subtleties. Recent studies on automated hate speech detection have focused on the use of deep learning as a possible solution to these challenges. Although some studies have explored deep learning methods for hate speech detection, there are no studies that critically compare and evaluate their performance. This work investigates the use of deep learning algorithms as possible solutions to hate speech detection on Twitter. Three taxonomic classes of deep learning algorithms, namely, Traditional deep learning algorithms, Traditional algorithms with partial attention mechanism and Transformer models, which are entirely based on the attention mechanism, are evaluated for performance, using two publicly available corpora. One of the datasets contained 24 786 tweets annotated into three different classes, while the other dataset contained 2300 tweets annotated into two different classes. All tweets from the two datasets were first preprocessed to rid of them of characters and words deemed irrelevant to the classification decision, for instance, hashtags, stop words and punctuation marks. The preprocessed text was then transformed into feature vectors which were used as input for deep learning algorithms explored in this study. A series of experiments were performed to measure the performance of the deep learning algorithms in hate speech detection. The algorithms were tested on a wide spectrum of tweets containing different forms of hate speech. The efficacy of the deep learning algorithms was objectively evaluated using six state-of-the-art statistical evaluation metrics: precision, Fmeasure, recall, accuracy, Mathews correlation coefficient and area under the curve. The results from this study indicate that variations in parameters do not impact the efficacy of deep learning algorithms by the same proportions. The findings of this empirical study, therefore, provide deep-learning practitioners with a better understanding of the adaptation of robust deep-learning techniques for automated hate speech detection tasks.</jats:p>

AB  - This paper surveys the extant literature on machine learning, artificial intelligence, and deep learning mechanisms within the financial sphere using bibliometric methods. We considered the conceptual and social structure of publications in ML, AI, and DL in finance to better understand the research's status, development, and growth. The study finds an upsurge in publication trends within this research arena, with a bit of concentration around the financial domain. The institutional contributions from USA and China constitute much of the literature on applying ML and AI in finance. Our analysis identifies emerging research themes, with the most futuristic being ESG scoring using ML and AI. However, we find there is a lack of empirical academic research with a critical appraisal of these algorithmic-based advanced automated financial technologies. There are severe pitfalls in the prediction process using ML and AI due to algorithmic biases, mostly in the areas of insurance, credit scoring and mortgages. Thus, this study indicates the next evolution of ML and DL archetypes in the economic sphere and the need for a strategic turnaround in academics regarding these forces of disruption and innovation that are shaping the future of finance.

AB  - Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are still one of the leading causes of death globally, underscoring the importance of early and right risk prediction for effective preventive measures and therapeutic approaches. This study proposes an innovative hybrid ensemble learning framework that combines state-of-the-art machine learning models and explainable AI approaches to risk prediction for cardiovascular disease. Using a range of publicly accessible datasets, the suggested structure incorporates Gradient Boosting, CatBoost, and Neural Networks using a stacked ensemble architecture, resulting in more robust predictive performance than the constituent models. This is particularly interesting when visualised through techniques such as SHAP values, t-SNE and PCA projections which allows the study to explore the multidimensional aspects of the relationships between key risk factors including systolic/diastolic blood pressure, BMI, cholesterol-glucose ratio, alongside various lifestyle parameters. They build further on model interpretability through explainable AI methods so that clinicians can observe the involvement of each feature in generating the predictions. The hybrid model demonstrated strong predictive performance with an AUC-ROC score of 0.82, and confusion matrices showing a well-balanced classification of both positive and negative cases - achieving Precision: 81%, Recall: 83%, and F1-Score: 82% on the test dataset. The results highlight the potential of ensemble learning for addressing complex medical prediction problems and the need for models to be interpretable to ensure the trustworthiness of AI systems in healthcare settings. These findings provide an exciting opportunity toward better models of CVD risk prediction, potentially providing healthcare stakeholders with interpretable means to target treatments.

AB  - A predominant challenge in modern drug development is the identification of better therapeutics. Precision therapeutics, which have one molecular target, have been long-promised to be safer and more effective than traditional therapies. This approach has proven to be challenging for multiple reasons including lack of efficacy, acquired drug resistance, and narrow patient eligibility criteria. An alternative approach is the development of polypharmacologic drugs, which can exhibit efficacious behavior caused by more than one biological target. Rational development of these molecules requires improved methods to predict chemical structures that specifically target multiple drug targets. To address this need, we developed the Multi-Targeting Drug DREAM Challenge where we asked participants to predict single chemical entities that target pro-targets but avoid anti-targets for two unrelated diseases: RET-based tumors and a form of Tauopathy. Here, we report the results of this DREAM Challenge and the development of two neural network based machine learning approaches that were applied to the challenge of rational polypharmacology. Together, these platforms provide a potentially useful first step towards developing lead therapeutic compounds that address disease complexity through polypharmacology.

AB  - <AbstractText Label="BACKGROUND">Heart rate characteristics aid early detection of late-onset sepsis (LOS), but respiratory data contain additional signatures of illness due to infection. Predictive models using cardiorespiratory data may improve early sepsis detection. We hypothesized that heart rate (HR) and oxygenation (SpO<sub>2</sub>) data contain signatures that improve sepsis risk prediction over HR or demographics alone.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="METHODS">We analyzed cardiorespiratory data from very low birth weight (VLBW, &lt;1500 g) infants admitted to three NICUs. We developed and externally validated four machine learning models to predict LOS using features calculated every 10 m: mean, standard deviation, skewness, kurtosis of HR and SpO<sub>2</sub>, and cross-correlation. We compared feature importance, discrimination, calibration, and dynamic prediction across models and cohorts. We built models of demographics and HR or SpO<sub>2</sub> features alone for comparison with HR-SpO<sub>2</sub> models.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="RESULTS">Performance, feature importance, and calibration were similar among modeling methods. All models had favorable external validation performance. The HR-SpO<sub>2</sub> model performed better than models using either HR or SpO<sub>2</sub> alone. Demographics improved the discrimination of all physiologic data models but dampened dynamic performance.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="CONCLUSIONS">Cardiorespiratory signatures detect LOS in VLBW infants at 3 NICUs. Demographics risk-stratify, but predictive modeling with both HR and SpO<sub>2</sub> features provides the best dynamic risk prediction.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="IMPACT">Heart rate characteristics aid early detection of late-onset sepsis, but respiratory data contain signatures of illness due to infection. Predictive models using both heart rate and respiratory data may improve early sepsis detection. A cardiorespiratory early warning score, analyzing heart rate from electrocardiogram or pulse oximetry with SpO<sub>2</sub>, predicts late-onset sepsis within 24 h across multiple NICUs and detects sepsis better than heart rate characteristics or demographics alone. Demographics risk-stratify, but predictive modeling with both HR and SpO<sub>2</sub> features provides the best dynamic risk prediction. The results increase understanding of physiologic signatures of neonatal sepsis.</AbstractText>

The primary objectives were to create and validate CNN models trained on panoramic radiographs to achieve accurate dental age predictions using a standardized approach.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="Material and Methods" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">A dataset of 801 panoramic radiographs from outpatients aged 5 to 15 years was used. A CNN model for dental age estimation was developed using a 16-layer CNN architecture implemented in Python with TensorFlow and Scikit-learn, guided by the London Atlas of Tooth Development. The model included 6 convolutional layers for feature extraction, each followed by a pooling layer to reduce the spatial dimensions of the feature maps. A confusion matrix was used to evaluate key performance metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="Results" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">The proposed model achieved an overall accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score of 74% on the validation set. The highest F1 scores were observed in the 10-year and 12-year age groups, indicating superior performance in these categories. In contrast, the 6-year age group demonstrated the highest misclassification rate, highlighting potential challenges in accurately estimating age in younger individuals.</AbstractText>

AB  - We present a data-driven model that rates actions of the player in soccer with respect to their contribution to ball possession phases. This study approach consists of two interconnected parts: (i) a trajectory prediction model that is learned from real tracking data and predicts movements of players and (ii) a prediction model for the outcome of a ball possession phase. Interactions between players and a ball are captured by a graph recurrent neural network (GRNN) and we show empirically that the network reliably predicts both, player trajectories as well as outcomes of ball possession phases. We derive a set of aggregated performance indicators to compare players with respect to. to their contribution to the success of their team.

AB  - Pork and beef are the main resources of red meat in the world. However, not everyone can eat pork because of their religious background or other reasons. Therefore, it is very important to ensure the purity of the meat prior to being consumed. This research applied ensemble learning to optimize the classification on Electronic Nose Dataset for Pork Adulteration in Beef. Ensemble learning is one of a method that is widely used and the most successful method to improve performance. This research used several traditional machine learning algorithms and chose a machine learning algorithm, which produced the best result as the base classifier for ensemble learning to optimize the classification on Electronic Nose Dataset for Pork Adulteration in Beef. There were three ensemble learnings used in this research, namely hard voting, stacking, and bagging. The steps conducted in this research comprise (1) preprocessing by de-noising of the raw signals, (2) statistical feature extraction, (3) feature selection, (4) classification, (5) using ensemble learning to improve the performance, and (6) performance evaluation. The experiment result shows that hard voting ensemble learning using K-nearest neighbors (KNN) as base classifier is able to distinguish well between beef, pork, and pork adulteration in beef to seven classes which obtained 98.33% accuracy.

AB  - Laboratory instructions and recipes are sometimes edited into books with a wide circulation. Even in the late twentieth century, publications of this nature remained influential. For example, protocols from a 1980 summer course on gene cloning at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory provided the basis for a bestselling laboratory manual by Tom Maniatis, Ed Fritsch and Joe Sambrook. Not only did the Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual become a standard reference for molecular biologists (commonly called the ‘bible’), but also its recipes and clear instructions made gene cloning and recombinant DNA technologies accessible to non-specialists. Consequently, this laboratory manual contributed to the rapid spread of genetic-engineering techniques throughout the life sciences, as well as in industry. As is often the case with how-to books, however, finding a way to update methods in this rapidly changing field posed a challenge, and various molecular-biology reference books had different ways of dealing with knowledge obsolescence. This paper explores the origins of this manual, its publication history, its reception and its rivals – as well as the more recent migration of such laboratory manuals to the Internet.

AB  - To enhance the safety and reliability of fuel cell vehicles, a remote monitoring system based on 5th generation (5G) mobile networks and controller area networks (CANs) was designed, and a random forest (RF) algorithm for the fault diagnosis for eight typical malfunctions of its powertrain system was incorporated. Firstly, the information on the powertrain system was obtained through a 5G-based monitoring terminal, and the Alibaba Cloud IoT platform was utilized for data storage and remote monitoring. Secondly, a fault diagnosis model based on the RF algorithm was constructed for fault classification; its parameters were optimized with a genetic algorithm (GA), and it was applied on the Alibaba Cloud PAI platform. Finally, the performance of the proposed RF fault diagnosis model was evaluated by comparing it with three other classification models: random search conditioning, grid search conditioning, and Bayesian optimization. Results show that the model <i>accuracy</i>, <i>F</i>1 score, and <i>kappa</i> value of the optimized RF fault classification model are higher than the other three. The model achieves an <i>F</i>1 value of 97.77% in identifying multiple typical faults of the powertrain system, as validated by vehicle malfunction data. The method demonstrates the feasibility of remote monitoring and fault diagnosis for the powertrain system of fuel cell vehicles.

AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>In recent years, the use of unmanned aerial vehicles has spread across different fields of the industry due to their ease of deployment and minimal operational risk. Firefighting is a dangerous task for the humans involved, in which the use of UAVs presents itself as a good first-action protocol for a rapid response to an incipient fire because of their safety and speed of action. Current research is mainly focused on wildland fires, but fires in urban environments are barely mentioned in the bibliography. To motivate the research on this topic, ICUAS’22 organized an international competition inspired by this mission, with the challenge of a UAV traversing an area populated by obstacles, finding a target, and precisely throwing a ball to it. For this competition, the Computer Vision and Aerial Robotics (CVAR-UPM) team developed a solution composed of multiple modules and structured by a mission planner. In this paper, we describe our approach and the developed architecture that led us to be awarded the first prize in the competition.</jats:p>

        <p>Huntington’s Disease (HD) is caused by an expanded CAG repeat in the huntingtin gene, yielding a Huntingtin protein with an expanded polyglutamine tract. Patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) can help understand disease; however, defining pathological biomarkers is challenging. Here, we used cryogenic electron tomography to visualize neurites in HD patient iPSC-derived neurons with varying CAG repeats, and primary cortical neurons from BACHD, deltaN17-BACHD, and wild-type mice. In HD models, we discovered mitochondria with enlarged granules and distorted cristae, and thin sheet aggregates in double membrane-bound organelles. We used artificial intelligence to quantify mitochondrial granules, and proteomics showed differential protein content in HD mitochondria. Knockdown of Protein Inhibitor of Activated STAT1 ameliorated aberrant phenotypes in iPSC-neurons and reduced phenotypes in BACHD neurons. We show that integrated ultrastructural and proteomic approaches may uncover early HD phenotypes to accelerate diagnostics and the development of targeted therapeutics for HD.</p>

AB  - Motivation Increasing evidence suggests that post-transcriptional ribonucleic acid (RNA) modifications regulate essential biomolecular functions and are related to the pathogenesis of various diseases. Precise identification of RNA modification sites is essential for understanding the regulatory mechanisms of RNAs. To date, many computational approaches for predicting RNA modifications have been developed, most of which were based on strong supervision enabled by base-resolution epitranscriptome data. However, high-resolution data may not be available. Results We propose WeakRM, the first weakly supervised learning framework for predicting RNA modifications from low-resolution epitranscriptome datasets, such as those generated from acRIP-seq and hMeRIP-seq. Evaluations on three independent datasets (corresponding to three different RNA modification types and their respective sequencing technologies) demonstrated the effectiveness of our approach in predicting RNA modifications from low-resolution data. WeakRM outperformed state-of-the-art multi-instance learning methods for genomic sequences, such as WSCNN, which was originally designed for transcription factor binding site prediction. Additionally, our approach captured motifs that are consistent with existing knowledge, and visualization of the predicted modification-containing regions unveiled the potentials of detecting RNA modifications with improved resolution. Availability implementation The source code for the WeakRM algorithm, along with the datasets used, are freely accessible at: https://github.com/daiyun02211/WeakRM. Supplementary information Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.

AB  - The aim of establishing hotels is to provide a service activity to its customers with the aim of making a profit. So, for that the cancellations are a key perspective of inn income administration since their effectiveness on room reservation systems. Cancelling the reservation eliminates the outcome. Many expected factors affect this problem. By knowing these factors, the hotel management can make a suitable cancellation policy. This project aims to create an API that can provide a function to predict if a reservation is most likely to cancel or not. That API can integrate with the hotel management systems to evaluate each reservation process with the same parameters. To do this, the study starts by defining the factors using Chi test, correlation to find the effective variables, and coefficient of the variables in the linear regression. And the results that have been found for the factors are: is repeated guest, previous cancellations, previous bookings not cancelled, required car parking spaces, and deposit type. For API function, the intercept and coefficients have been used from the logistics regression model to create a scoring function. Scoring function can be calculated by the sum of the factors multiplied by their coefficients in addition to the intercept. This score is to be evaluated as a probability later using the logistic function.

AB  - This research presents a novel data-driven framework for predicting the mechanical properties of waste glass aggregate concrete using six advanced metaheuristic optimization algorithms: Bat Algorithm (Bat), Cuckoo Search Algorithm (Cuckoo), Elephant Herding Optimization (Elephant), Firefly Algorithm (Firefly), Rhinoceros Optimization Algorithm (Rhino), and Gray Wolf Optimizer (Wolf). The study evaluates these models based on their ability to predict compressive strength (Fc), tensile strength (Ft), density, and slump using key statistical performance indicators such as SSE, MAE, MSE, RMSE, accuracy, R<sup>2</sup>, and KGE. Sensitivity analysis was conducted using Hoffman and Gardener's method as well as the SHAP technique to determine the most influential parameter in the prediction process. Results indicate that the Firefly and Wolf algorithms exhibited the highest prediction accuracy across all four properties, with Wolf emerging as the overall best-performing model due to its superior generalization ability, lower error rates, and high correlation with experimental results. Among the input parameters, the water-to-binder ratio was identified as the most influential factor affecting the mechanical properties of waste glass aggregate concrete, as demonstrated by both sensitivity analysis methods. This highlights the critical role of optimal water content in achieving desirable strength and workability in sustainable concrete mixtures. The study's novelty lies in the comparative assessment of multiple optimization algorithms applied to waste-based concrete, an approach that has not been extensively explored in previous research. Additionally, the integration of SHAP analysis for feature importance ranking provides an interpretable machine learning approach to concrete mix design, which enhances decision-making for engineers and researchers. The practical implications of this research extend to sustainable machine learning-based concrete design, where AI-driven optimization can help reduce the reliance on conventional trial-and-error methods. By utilizing waste glass aggregates, the study supports circular economy initiatives in construction, reducing environmental impact while maintaining structural performance. The proposed models can be implemented in real-world scenarios to optimize mix designs for large-scale applications, leading to cost-effective and eco-friendly construction materials. This research advances the field of smart construction by demonstrating the effectiveness of machine learning in sustainable material engineering, paving the way for future AI-assisted innovations in the industry.

AB  - A genomic signature for endosporulation includes a gene coding for a protease, YabG, which in the model organism Bacillus subtilis is involved in assembly of the spore coat. We show that in the human pathogen Clostridioidesm difficile, YabG is critical for the assembly of the coat and exosporium layers of spores. YabG is produced during sporulation under the control of the mother cell-specific regulators σE and σK and associates with the spore surface layers. YabG shows an N-terminal SH3-like domain and a C-terminal domain that resembles single domain response regulators, such as CheY, yet is atypical in that the conserved phosphoryl-acceptor residue is absent. Instead, the CheY-like domain carries residues required for activity, including Cys207 and His161, the homologues of which form a catalytic diad in the B. subtilis protein, and also Asp162. The substitution of any of these residues by Ala, eliminates an auto-proteolytic activity as well as interdomain processing of CspBA, a reaction that releases the CspB protease, required for proper spore germination. An in-frame deletion of yabG or an allele coding for an inactive protein, yabGC207A, both cause misassemby of the coat and exosporium and the formation of spores that are more permeable to lysozyme and impaired in germination and host colonization. Furthermore, we show that YabG is required for the expression of at least two σK-dependent genes, cotA, coding for a coat protein, and cdeM, coding for a key determinant of exosporium assembly. Thus, YabG also impinges upon the genetic program of the mother cell possibly by eliminating a transcriptional repressor. Although this activity has not been described for the B. subtilis protein and most of the YabG substrates vary among sporeformers, the general role of the protease in the assembly of the spore surface is likely to be conserved across evolutionary distance.

AB  - Facial movements are crucial for human interaction because they provide relevant information on verbal and non-verbal communication and social interactions. From a clinical point of view, the analysis of facial movements is important for diagnosis, follow-up, drug therapy, and surgical treatment. Current methods of assessing facial palsy are either (i) objective but inaccurate, (ii) subjective and, thus, depending on the clinician's level of experience, or (iii) based on static data. To address the aforementioned problems, we implemented a deep learning algorithm to assess facial movements during smiling. Such a model was trained on a dataset that contains healthy smiles only following an anomaly detection strategy. Generally speaking, the degree of anomaly is computed by comparing the model's suggested healthy smile with the person's actual smile. The experimentation showed that the model successfully computed a high degree of anomaly when assessing the patients' smiles. Furthermore, a graphical user interface was developed to test its practical usage in a clinical routine. In conclusion, we present a deep learning model, implemented on open-source software, designed to help clinicians to assess facial movements.

AB  - Constructing offshore and coastal structures with the highest level of stability and lowest cost, as well as the prevention of faulty risk, is the desired plan that stakeholders seek to obtain. The successful construction plans of such projects mostly rely on well-analyzed and modeled metocean data that yield high prediction accuracy for the ocean environmental conditions including waves and wind. Over the past decades, planning and designing coastal projects have been accomplished by traditional static analytic, which requires tremendous efforts and high-cost resources to validate the data and determine the transformation of metocean data conditions. Therefore, the wind plays an essential role in the oceanic atmosphere and contributes to the formation of waves. This paper proposes an enhanced weight-optimized neural network based on Sine Cosine Algorithm (SCA) to accurately predict the wave height. Three neural network models named: Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Vanilla Recurrent Neural Network (VRNN), and Gated Recurrent Network (GRU) are enhanced, instead of random weight initialization, SCA generates weight values that are adaptable to the nature of the data and model structure. Besides, a Grid Search (GS) is utilized to automatically find the best models’ configurations. To validate the performance of the proposed models, metocean datasets have been used. The original LSTM, VRNN, and GRU are implemented and used as benchmarking models. The results show that the optimized models outperform the original three benchmarking models in terms of mean squared error (MSE), root mean square error (RMSE), and mean absolute error (MAE).

AB  - The persistence and emergence of new multi-drug resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tb) strains continues to advance the devastating tuberculosis (TB) epidemic. Robust systems are needed to accurately and rapidly perform drug-resistance profiling, and machine learning (ML) methods combined with genomic sequence data may provide novel insights into drug-resistance mechanisms. Using 372 M. tb isolates, the combined utility of ML and bioinformatics to perform drug-resistance profiling is demonstrated. SNPs, InDels, and dinucleotide frequencies are explored as input features for three ML models, namely Decision Trees, Random Forest, and the eXtreme Gradient Boosted model. Using SNPs and InDels, all three models performed equally well yielding a 99% accuracy, 97% recall, and 99% F1-score. Using dinucleotide frequencies, the XGBoost algorithm was superior with a 97% accuracy, 94% recall and 97% F1-score. This study validates the use of variants and presents dinucleotide features as another effective feature encoding method for ML-based phenotype classification.

AB  - Ordering of different chalcogens, S, Se, and Te, on Au(111) exhibit broad similarities but also some distinct features, which must reflect subtle differences in relative values of the long-range pair and many-body lateral interactions between adatoms. We develop lattice-gas (LG) models within a cluster expansion framework, which includes about 50 interaction parameters. These LG models are developed based on density functional theory (DFT) analysis of the energetics of key adlayer configurations in combination with the Monte Carlo (MC) simulation of the LG models to identify statistically relevant adlayer motifs, i.e., model development is based entirely on theoretical considerations. The MC simulation guides additional DFT analysis and iterative model refinement. Given their complexity, development of optimal models is also aided by strategies from supervised machine learning. The model for S successfully captures ordering motifs over a broader range of coverage than achieved by previous models, and models for Se and Te capture the features of ordering, which are distinct from those for S. More specifically, the modeling for all three chalcogens successfully explains the linear adatom rows (also subtle differences between them) observed at low coverages of ∼0.1 monolayer. The model for S also leads to a new possible explanation for the experimentally observed phase with a (5 × 5)-type low energy electron diffraction (LEED) pattern at 0.28 ML and to predictions for LEED patterns that would be observed with Se and Te at this coverage.

AB  - espanolGiven its importance in financial risk management, credit risk analysis, since its introduction in 1950, has been a major influence both in academic research and in practical situations. In this work, a systematic literature review is proposed which considers both “Credit Risk” and “Credit risk” as search parameters to answer two main research questions: are machine learning techniques being effectively applied in research about credit risk evaluation? Furthermore, which of these quantitative techniques have been mostly applied over the last ten years of research? Different steps were followed to select the papers for the analysis, as well as the exclusion criteria, in order to verify only papers with Machine Learning approaches. Among the results, it was found that machine learning is being extensively applied in Credit Risk Assessment, where applications of Artificial Intelligence (AI) were mostly found, more specifically Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). After the explanation of each answer, a discussion of the results is presented. EnglishDada su importancia en la gestion del riesgo financiero, el analisis del riesgo crediticio, desde su introduccion en 1950, ha tenido una gran influencia tanto en investigaciones academicas como en situaciones practicas. En este trabajo se propone una revision bibliografica sistematica que considere “Credit Risk” y “Credit risk” como parametros de busqueda para responder dos preguntas de investigacion principales: ?se estan aplicando efectivamente las tecnicas de aprendizaje automatico en las investigaciones sobre la evaluacion del riesgo de credito? Incluso, ?cuales de estas tecnicas cuantitativas se han aplicado mayoritariamente en los ultimos diez anos de investigacion? Se siguieron diferentes pasos para seleccionar los articulos para el analisis, asi como los criterios de exclusion para verificar solo los articulos con enfoques de aprendizaje automatico. Entre los resultados, se encontro que el aprendizaje automatico se esta aplicando ampliamente en la Evaluacion de Riesgo de Credito, donde en su mayoria se encontraron aplicaciones de Inteligencia Artificial (AI), mas especificamente, de Redes Neuronales Artificiales (ANN). Despues de la explicacion de cada respuesta, se presenta una discusion sobre los resultados.

AB  - Due to the spectral complexity and high dimensionality of hyperspectral images (HSIs), the processing of HSIs is susceptible to the curse of dimensionality. In addition, the classification results of ground truth are not ideal. To overcome the problem of the curse of dimensionality and improve classification accuracy, an improved spatial-spectral weight manifold embedding (ISS-WME) algorithm, which is based on hyperspectral data with their own manifold structure and local neighbors, is proposed in this study. The manifold structure was constructed using the structural weight matrix and the distance weight matrix. The structural weight matrix was composed of within-class and between-class coefficient representation matrices. These matrices were obtained by using the collaborative representation method. Furthermore, the distance weight matrix integrated the spatial and spectral information of HSIs. The ISS-WME algorithm describes the whole structure of the data by the weight matrix constructed by combining the within-class and between-class matrices and the spatial-spectral information of HSIs, and the nearest neighbor samples of the data are retained without changing when embedding to the low-dimensional space. To verify the classification effect of the ISS-WME algorithm, three classical data sets, namely Indian Pines, Pavia University, and Salinas scene, were subjected to experiments for this paper. Six methods of dimensionality reduction (DR) were used for comparison experiments using different classifiers such as k-nearest neighbor (KNN) and support vector machine (SVM). The experimental results show that the ISS-WME algorithm can represent the HSI structure better than other methods, and effectively improves the classification accuracy of HSIs.

AB  - The patient's experience is a lens for services assessment that provide from healthcare institutions because the patient is the first and the last recipient for the service. The patient's experience carries a lot of uncertainty and an ultimate decision cannot be taken from the patient about the services, but it carries the partial truth. Many artificial intelligence technologies deal with the concept of partial truth, such as genetic algorithms and neural networks, but the fuzzy logic remains pioneering to deal with uncertainty. This paper aims to develop an assessment model by using fuzzy inference that is able to assess the quality of services in a similar way to the human experts of healthcare. The fuzzy assessment model applied to measure the patient satisfaction rate for health services for more 4500 hospitals in the United States and two hospitals in Iraq. The services are assessed by the questionnaire and its design according to the questionnaire of the assessment of healthcare providers and systems (HCAHPS) for all hospitals in the United State. The population study in Iraq consisted of 1,000 patients divided between 500 patients from Al-Hillah general teaching hospital and 500 patients from Al-Kafil private hospital. Depending on the patients' answers, the degrees of membership are calculated among the fuzzy sets. The results show a clear difference between the services provided by private hospitals compared to public hospitals.

AB  - Modern weather forecasts are commonly issued as consistent multi-day forecast trajectories with a time resolution of 1-3 hours. Prior to issuing, statistical post-processing is routinely used to correct systematic errors and misrepresentations of the forecast uncertainty. However, once the forecast has been issued, it is rarely updated before it is replaced in the next forecast cycle of the numerical weather prediction (NWP) model. This paper shows that the error correlation structure within the forecast trajectory can be utilized to substantially improve the forecast between the NWP forecast cycles by applying additional post-processing steps each time new observations become available. The proposed rapid adjustment is applied to temperature forecast trajectories from the UK Met Office's convective-scale ensemble MOGREPS-UK. MOGREPS-UK is run four times daily and produces hourly forecasts for up to 36 hours ahead. Our results indicate that the rapidly adjusted forecast from the previous NWP forecast cycle outperforms the new forecast for the first few hours of the next cycle, or until the new forecast itself can be rapidly adjusted, suggesting a new strategy for updating the forecast cycle.

AB  - In many real-world inverse problems, only incomplete measurement data are available for training which can pose a problem for learning a reconstruction function. Indeed, unsupervised learning using a fixed incomplete measurement process is impossible in general, as there is no information in the nullspace of the measurement operator. This limitation can be overcome by using measurements from multiple operators. While this idea has been successfully applied in various applications, a precise characterization of the conditions for learning is still lacking. In this paper, we fill this gap by presenting necessary and sufficient conditions for learning the underlying signal model needed for reconstruction which indicate the interplay between the number of distinct measurement operators, the number of measurements per operator, the dimension of the model and the dimension of the signals. Furthermore, we propose a novel and conceptually simple unsupervised learning loss which only requires access to incomplete measurement data and achieves a performance on par with supervised learning when the sufficient condition is verified. We validate our theoretical bounds and demonstrate the advantages of the proposed unsupervised loss compared to previous methods via a series of experiments on various imaging inverse problems, such as accelerated magnetic resonance imaging, compressed sensing and image inpainting.

AB  - Life Expectancy (LE) models have vast effects on many countries' social and financial structures around the world. Many studies have suggested the essential implications of Life expectancy predictions on social aspects and healthcare system management around the globe. These models provide many ways to improve healthcare and advanced care planning mechanism related to society. However, with time, it was observed that many present determinants were not enough to predict the generic set of populations' longevity. Previous models were based upon mortality-based knowledge of the targeted sampling population. With the advancement in forecasting technologies and rigorous work of past individuals has proposed that other than mortality rate, there are still many factors needed to be addressed to deduce the standard Predicated Life expectancy models (PrLE). Due to this, now Life expectancy is being studied with some additional set of interests into educational, health, economic, and social welfare services. Our objective here will be to briefly discuss the previously used machine learning, Ensemble methods and hybrid methods used in building life expectancy prediction models. We will aim to test the potential and accuracy of existing ML techniques and their probabilistic projections to predict the generic Life expectancy of a particular region, state.

          <jats:p>Predictive modeling plays a crucial role in machine learning, data analysis, and statistics. In sports, predictive modeling methods have emerged to provide insights and evaluate performances based on key performance metrics. However, most existing models tend to focus on predicting only partial aspects of an event, such as the outcome, action type, or location, while neglecting the temporal factors involved. To address this gap, this study introduces the Transformer-Based Neural Marked Spatio-Temporal Point Process (NMSTPP) model, specifically designed for football event data. The NMSTPP model predicts a comprehensive set of future event components, including inter-event time, zone, and action. Additionally, it features a dependent prediction layers architecture to enhance model performance. The Holistic Possession Utilization Score (HPUS) metric is also proposed to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of possession periods in football based on the NMSTPP model. With open-source football event data, the NMSTPP model successfully predicted the aforementioned three components of future events, with an improvement of up to 4% overall and 9% for individual components compared to baseline models. The HPUS demonstrated a 0.9 correlation with existing performance metrics, highlighting its utility in performance evaluation. The NMSTPP and HPUS were applied to the Premier League to demonstrate their practical feasibility.</jats:p>

AB  - The most common gynecologic cancer, behind cervical and uterine, is ovarian cancer. Ovarian cancer is a severe concern for women. Abnormal cells form and spread throughout the body. Ovarian cancer microarray data can diagnose and prognosis. Typically, ovarian cancer microarray data contains tens of thousands of genes. In order to reduce computational complexity, selecting the most critical genes or attributes in the entire dataset is necessary. Because microarray datasets have limited samples and many characteristics, classifier detection lags. So, dimensionality reduction measures are essential to protect disease classification genes. In this research, initially the ANOVA method is used for gene selection and then two clustering-based and three transform-based feature extraction methods, namely, Fuzzy C Means, Softmax Discriminant Algorithm (SDA), Hilbert Transform, Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), and Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT), respectively, are used to select relevant genes further. Six classifiers further classify the features as normal and abnormal. The NLR classifier gives the highest accuracy for SDA features at 92%, and KNN gives the lowest accuracy of 55% for SDA, Hilbert, and DCT features. With correlation distance feature selection, the NLR classifier attains the lowest accuracy of 53%, and the highest accuracy of 88% is obtained by the GMM classifier.

AB  - Exploring an effective method to manage the complex breast cancer clinical information and selecting a suitable classifier for predictive modeling still require continuous research and verification in the actual clinical environment. This paper combines the ultrasound image feature algorithm to construct a breast cancer classification model. Furthermore, it combines the motion process of the ultrasound probe to accurately connect the ultrasound probe to the breast tumor. Moreover, this paper constructs a hardware and software system structure through machine vision algorithms and intelligent motion algorithms. Furthermore, it combines coordinate transformation and image recognition algorithms to expand the recognition process to realize automatic and intelligent real-time breast cancer diagnosis. In addition, this paper combines machine learning algorithms to process data and obtain an intelligent system model. Finally, this paper designs experiments to verify the intelligent system of this paper. Through experimental research, it can be seen that the breast cancer classification prediction system based on ultrasonic image feature recognition has certain effects.

AB  - Predicting cardiac disease is considered one of the most challenging tasks in the medical field. It takes a lot of time and effort to figure out what's causing this, especially for doctors and other medical experts. In this paper, various Machine Learning algorithms such as LR, KNN, SVM, and GBC, together with the GridSearchCV, predict cardiac disease. The system uses a 5-fold cross-validation technique for verification. A comparative study is given for these four methodologies. The Datasets for both Cleveland, Hungary, Switzerland, and Long Beach V and UCI Kaggle are used to analyze the models' performance. It is found in the analysis that the Extreme Gradient Boosting Classifier with GridSearchCV gives the highest and nearly comparable testing and training accuracies as 100% and 99.03% for both the datasets (Hungary, Switzerland &; Long Beach V and UCI Kaggle). Moreover, it is found in the analysis that XGBoost Classifier without GridSearchCV gives the highest and nearly comparable testing and training accuracies as 98.05% and 100% for both the datasets (Hungary, Switzerland & Long Beach V and UCI Kaggle). Furthermore, the analytical results of the proposed technique are compared with previous heart disease prediction studies. It is evident that amongst the proposed approach, the Extreme Gradient Boosting Classifier with GridSearchCV is producing the best hyperparameter for testing accuracy. The primary aim of this paper is to develop a unique model-creation technique for solving real-world problems.

AB  - We propose a novel gaussian activated parametric (GAP) layer for deep neural networks specifically for CNN. This layer normalizes the feature vector using the Gaussian filter-based un-sharpening technique. The goal of the proposed method is to normalize and activate the initial and intermediate feature layers of a deep CNN so that a customized layer can make the feature more distinguish and layers are smoothly tuned for the target-domain classification. Our experiment shows the use of the proposed layer for normalization gives a result almost similar to that of batch normalization and in few cases, the result is slightly better at the cost of higher training time. To demonstrate the result of the proposed layer we are using 4 layers of an encoder-based network as a base architecture for classification in which the first two normalization layers are GAP layers or BN layers whereas the remaining are BN layers. The result of the experiment is better in classification with two GAP layer as normalization layer in a bulkier dataset like ADNI MRI (3D CNN accuracy: 93.58% vs. 91.89%) and CIFAR-10 (2D CNN accuracy: 75.21% vs. 75.11%), whereas the result is better with replacement of first BN layer with GAP in a smaller dataset like 5-animals dataset (2D CNN accuracy: 62.92% vs 58.48%). Therefore, we suggest the use of single GAP layer normalization for smaller datasets and two GAP normalization layers for bigger dataset training. Also, the proposed method produced better results than the cross-channel normalization-based AlexNet network under scratch training.

AB  - Abstract Background and aim Mortality risk stratification was vital for targeted intervention. This study aimed at building the prediction model of all-cause mortality among Chinese dwelling elderly with different methods including regression models and machine learning models and to compare the performance of machine learning models with regression model on predicting mortality. Additionally, this study also aimed at ranking the predictors of mortality within different models and comparing the predictive value of different groups of predictors using the model with best performance. Method I used data from the sub-study of Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey (CLHLS) - Healthy Ageing and Biomarkers Cohort Study (HABCS). The baseline survey of HABCS was conducted in 2008 and covered similar domains that CLHLS has investigated and shared the sampling strategy. The follow-up of HABCS was conducted every 2-3 years till 2018. The analysis sample included 2,448 participants from HABCS. I used totally 117 predictors to build the prediction model for survival using the HABCS cohort, including 61 questionnaire, 41 biomarker and 15 genetics predictors. Four models were built (XG-Boost, random survival forest [RSF], Cox regression with all variables and Cox-backward). We used C-index and integrated Brier score (Brier score for the two years’ mortality prediction model) to evaluate the performance of those models. Results The XG-Boost model and RSF model shows slightly better predictive performance than Cox models and Cox-backward models based on the C-index and integrated Brier score in predicting surviving. Age. Activity of daily living and Mini-Mental State Examination score were identified as the top 3 predictors in the XG-Boost and RSF models. Biomarker and questionnaire predictors have a similar predictive value, while genetic predictors have no addictive predictive value when combined with questionnaire or biomarker predictors. Conclusion In this work, it is shown that machine learning techniques can be a useful tool for both prediction and its performance sightly outperformed the regression model in predicting survival.

AB  - Many applications, especially in physics and other sciences, call for easily interpretable and robust machine learning techniques. We propose a fully gradient-based technique for training radial basis function networks with an efficient and scalable open-source implementation. We derive novel closed-form optimization criteria for pruning the models for continuous as well as binary data which arise in a challenging real-world material physics problem. The pruned models are optimized to provide compact and interpretable versions of larger models based on informed assumptions about the data distribution. Visualizations of the pruned models provide insight into the atomic configurations that determine atom-level migration processes in solid matter; these results may inform future research on designing more suitable descriptors for use with machine learning algorithms.

AB  - Osteosynthesis systems, which consist of plates and screws, are applied to fixate bone segments in maxillofacial trauma and orthognathic surgery. Titanium osteosynthesis systems are currently widely used and accepted as the gold standard. However, their disadvantages include – among others – temperature sensitivity, tactile sensation of plates and screws, possible growth restrictions of the underlying bone, hampering of radiological imaging and radiotherapy, and accumulation of titanium particles in the surrounding tissues and different organs with potential mutagenicity. Biodegradable plates and screws may reduce removal rates in a second operation, while also avoiding most of the aforementioned disadvantages of titanium osteosyntheses. Biodegradable systems have, however, their own limitations including limited mechanical properties, palpability due to bulkiness, and possible foreign body reactions. To guide the evidence-based selection of osteosynthesis systems, the research described in this thesis aimed to compare the in vitro and in vivo performances of different biodegradable osteosynthesis systems as well as to compare the (clinical) performance of biodegradable and titanium osteosynthesis systems. It was concluded that biodegradable osteosyntheses are a viable alternative to titanium osteosyntheses when applied to treat maxillofacial trauma, with similar efficacy and significantly lower symptomatic osteosynthesis removal, but with higher perioperative screw breakage. For orthognathic surgery, biodegradable osteosynthesis also is a valid alternative to titanium osteosynthesis, but with longer operation times. It was shown that the biodegradable SonicWeld 2.1 mm system (poly[D,L-lactic acid]) had the most predictable degradation profile compared to other commonly used biodegradable systems. Furthermore, the SonicWeld 2.1 mm biodegradable systems had the most favourable mechanical properties for midface fracture fixation and osteotomies, and the Inion CPS 2.5 mm biodegradable system (poly[L-co-D,L-lactic acid-co-trimethylene carbonate]) for mandibular fractures and osteotomies. Finally, it was shown that the residents’ accuracy and reliability in applying torque to titanium osteosynthesis 1.5 mm screws were insufficient, but that both accuracy and reliability could be improved using a simple preclinical training model. These findings provide new insights into the biocompatibility, and biomechanical and degradation properties of (biodegradable) osteosynthesis systems that can be used for evidence-based selection and usage of such systems in maxillofacial surgery as well as to provide leads for future research.

AB  - This paper explores the energy-intensive cement industry, focusing on a plant in Greece and its mill and kiln unit. The data utilized include manipulated, non-manipulated, and uncontrolled variables. The non-manipulated variables are computed based on the machine learning (ML) models and selected by the minimum value of the normalized root mean square error (<i>NRMSE</i>) across nine (9) methods. In case the distribution of the data displayed in the user interface changes, the user should trigger the retrain of the AI models to ensure their accuracy and robustness. To form the objective function, the expert user should define the desired weight for each manipulated or non-manipulated variable through the user interface (UI), along with its corresponding constraints or target value. The user selects the variables involved in the objective function based on the optimization strategy, and the evaluation is based on the comparison of the optimized and the active value of the objective function. The differential evolution (DE) method optimizes the objective function that is formed by the linear combination of the selected variables. The results indicate that using DE improves the operation of both the cement mill and kiln, yielding a lower objective function value compared to the current values.

AB  - Bayesian Decision Trees provide a probabilistic framework that reduces the instability of Decision Trees while maintaining their explainability. While Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods are typically used to construct Bayesian Decision Trees, here we provide a deterministic Bayesian Decision Tree algorithm that eliminates the sampling and does not require a pruning step. This algorithm generates the greedy-modal tree (GMT) which is applicable to both regression and classification problems. We tested the algorithm on various benchmark classification data sets and obtained similar accuracies to other known techniques. Furthermore, we show that we can statistically analyze how was the GMT derived from the data and demonstrate this analysis with a financial example. Notably, the GMT allows for a technique that provides explainable simpler models which is often a prerequisite for applications in finance or the medical industry.

AB  - COVID-19 has altered our lifestyle, communication, employment, and also our emotions. The pandemic and its devastating implications have had a significant impact on higher education, as well as other sectors. Numerous researchers have utilized typical statistical methods to determine the effect of COVID-19 on the psychological wellbeing of young people. Moreover, the primary aspects that have changed in the psychological condition of children and young adults during COVID lockdown is analyzed. These changes are analyzed using machine learning and AI techniques which should be established for the alterations. This research work mainly concentrates on children's and young people's mental health in the first lockdown. There are six processes involved in this work. Initially, it collects the data using questionnaires, and then, the collected data are pre-processed by data cleaning, categorical encoding, and data normalization method. Next, the clustering process is used for grouping the data based on their mood state, and then, the feature selection process is done by chi-square, L1-Norm, and ReliefF. Then, the machine learning classifiers are used for predicting the mood state, and automatic calibration is used for selecting the best model. Finally, it predicts the mood state of the children and young adults. The findings revealed that for a better understanding of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on children's and youths' mental states, a combination of heterogeneous data from practically all feature groups is required.

AB  - Focusing on the issues of the effects of the high failure rate and poor maintenance on the ZPW-2000A track circuit during in-field operations, this paper proposes a multi-objective maintenance decision optimization method by considering the number of maintenance personnel. The developed method introduces not only the service age regression, increased failure rate, system’s average reliability, maintenance costs, but also the availability calculation model in the case of multiple maintenance personnel. We solve the model using the integer coded BB-MOPSO algorithm, and obtain the Pareto front solution set, and then the optimal maintenance plan of the system is further established. In addition, the number of optimal maintenance personnel is analyzed in detail. Compared to the results of traditional maintenance strategies, the results obtained in this paper show that the proposed model can reduce the maintenance costs, under the same working conditions, by 13.29%, moreover, it can more comprehensively reflect the impact of maintenance activities on the system reliability, maintenance costs, and availability. Furthermore, the method can meet the needs of decision-makers for diversified solutions and can provide an effective decision support while on site.

AB  - We developed DreamDIA-XMBD, a software suite for data-independent acquisition (DIA) data analysis. DreamDIA-XMBD adopts a data-driven strategy to capture comprehensive information from elution patterns of target peptides in DIA data and achieves considerable improvements on both identification and quantification performance compared with other state-of-the-art methods such as OpenSWATH, Skyline and DIA-NN. More specifically, in contrast to existing methods which use only 6 to 10 selected transitions from spectral library, DreamDIA-XMBD extracts additional features from dozens of theoretical elution profiles originated from different ions of each precursor using a deep representation network. To achieve higher coverage of target peptides without sacrificing specificity, the extracted features are further processed by non-linear discriminative models under the framework of positive-unlabeled learning with decoy peptides as affirmative negative controls. DreamDIA-XMBD is written in Python, and is publicly available at https://github.com/xmuyulab/Dream-DIA-XMBD for high coverage and precision DIA data analysis.

AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>
          <jats:p>Machine learning has become an essential component across various domains, including the education sector. Accurately predicting students’ academic performance plays a critical role for teachers and school administrators—not only in enhancing the quality of education but also in influencing educational outcomes. In this study, we propose an innovative system capable of predicting student achievement with high accuracy. We analyze a data set containing student-related features such as gender, race/ethnicity, parental education level, participation in breakfast programs, test preparation, participation in courses, computer science scores, and literacy skills. A supervised machine learning approach, specifically the random forest algorithm, was employed to build the prediction model. Redundant features were eliminated to reduce complexity and computational cost. Additionally, a comparative analysis was conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The findings of this research have the potential to transform educational decision-making and support a more data-driven and effective strategy for improving academic outcomes.</jats:p>

AB  - In this paper, we minimize and compare two different fine-tuning measures in four high-scale supersymmetric models that are embedded in the MSSM. In addition, we determine the impact of current and future dark matter direct detection and collider experiments on the fine-tuning. We then compare the low-scale electroweak measure with the high-scale Barbieri-Giudice measure. We find that they reduce to the same value when the higgsino parameter drives the degree of fine-tuning. We also find spectra where the high-scale measure turns out to be lower than the low-scale measure. Depending on the high-scale model and fine-tuning definition, we find a minimal fine-tuning of 3–38 (corresponding to O(10–1)%) for the low-scale measure, and 63–571 (corresponding to O(1–0.1)%) for the high-scale measure. We stress that it is too early to conclude on the fate of supersymmetry, based only on the fine-tuning paradigm.

AB  - The escalating distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks severely threatens the security of the industrial internet of things (IIoT). This paper introduces moving target defense (MTD) as an adaptive solution to fortify IIoT security against DDoS attacks. Dynamically reconfiguring network elements and service placements makes it challenging for attackers to target specific vulnerabilities. We propose an MTD traffic manager (MTDTM) architecture to enable early detection and mitigation of DDoS attacks within resource-constrained edge clouds. A traffic classifier is integrated into our model to intelligently filter incoming traffic, ensuring real-time responsiveness to the demands of IIoT applications. Moreover, dynamic admission rules and relocation of service replicas efficiently distribute the traffic, ensuring the availability of services for legitimate users. Unlike traditional static defense methods, our adaptive approach caters to the evolving DDoS threat landscape of IIoT, safeguarding critical industrial processes. Simulation results validate the efficiency of our algorithm while maintaining an acceptable quality of service. Our research demonstrated a 15% to 20% improvement in service response times compared to existing algorithms. Notably, we achieved significant enhancements in average resource availability during DDoS attacks across various parameter variations.

AB  - Oil structuring is a strategy used to change the physical state of liquid oils to mimic the behavior of solid fats. In the past years, following the legislative bans on using partially hydrogenated fats and recommendations on limiting saturated fatty acid intake, oil structuring has become a fast-developing research area. This review explores the current state of applications developed for oil structuring, considering the challenges and prospects. Processes such as direct and indirect oleogelation, as well as interesterification (acidolysis, alcoholysis, glycerolysis, and transesterification), are described, outlining the main factors governing them. The review also presents the potential applications and enhancement of the functional properties of structured oils in various food formulations. From the latest literature, the industrial applicability of structured oils is discussed. This work provides a well-structured overview of the broad and diverse topic of fat mimetics and oil structuring, creating a solid base for a better understanding of the topic and spotting the challenges associated with their application.

AB  - <jats:p>In the Chinese stock market, the unique special treatment (ST) warning mechanism can signal financial distress for listed companies. In existing studies, classification model has been developed to differentiate the two general listing states. However, this classification model cannot explain the internal changes of each listing state. Considering that the requirement of the withdrawal of ST in the mechanism is relatively loose, we propose a new segmentation approach for Chinese listed companies, which are divided into negative companies and positive companies according to the number of times being labeled ST. Under the framework of data mining, we use financial indicators, non-financial indicators, and time series to build a financial distress prediction model of distinguishing the long-term development of different Chinese listed companies. Through data segmentation, we find that the negative samples have a huge destructive interference on the prediction effect of the total sample. On the contrary, positive companies improve the prediction accuracy in all aspects and the optimal feature set is also different from all companies. The main contribution of the paper is to analyze the internal impact of the deterioration of financial distress prediction in time series and construct an optimization model for positive companies.</jats:p>

AB  - Traditional imaging systems exhibit a well-known trade-off between the resolution and the field of view of their captured images. Typical cameras and microscopes can either “zoom in” and image at high-resolution, or they can “zoom out” to see a larger area at lower resolution, but can rarely achieve both effects simultaneously. In this review, we present details about a relatively new procedure termed Fourier ptychography (FP), which addresses the above trade-off to produce gigapixel-scale images without requiring any moving parts. To accomplish this, FP captures multiple low-resolution, large field-of-view images and computationally combines them in the Fourier domain into a high-resolution, large field-of-view result. Here, we present details about the various implementations of FP and highlight its demonstrated advantages to date, such as aberration recovery, phase imaging, and 3D tomographic reconstruction, to name a few. After providing some basics about FP, we list important details for successful experimental implementation, discuss its relationship with other computational imaging techniques, and point to the latest advances in the field while highlighting persisting challenges.

AB  - Model-based and data-driven methods are commonly used in leak location strategies in water distribution networks. This paper formulates a hybrid methodology in two stages that complements the advantages and disadvantages of data-driven and model-based strategies. In the first stage, a support vector machine multiclass classifier is used to reduce the search space for the leak location task. In the second stage, leak location task is formulated as an inverse problem, and solved using a variation of the differential evolution algorithm called topological differential evolution. The robustness of the method is tested considering measurement and varying demand uncertainty conditions ranging from 5 to 15% of node nominal demands. The performance of the hybrid method is compared to the support vector machine classifier and topological differential evolution approaches as standalone methods of leak location. The hybrid proposal shows higher performance in terms of location accuracy, zone size, and computational load.

AB  - The control of virus spreading over complex networks with a limited budget has attracted much attention but remains challenging. This article aims at addressing the combinatorial, discrete resource allocation problems (RAPs) in virus spreading control. To meet the challenges of increasing network scales and improve the solving efficiency, an evolutionary divide-and-conquer algorithm is proposed, namely, a coevolutionary algorithm with network-community-based decomposition (NCD-CEA). It is characterized by the community-based dividing technique and cooperative coevolution conquering thought. First, to reduce the time complexity, NCD-CEA divides a network into multiple communities by a modified community detection method such that the most relevant variables in the solution space are clustered together. The problem and the global swarm are subsequently decomposed into subproblems and subswarms with low-dimensional embeddings. Second, to obtain high-quality solutions, an alternative evolutionary approach is designed by promoting the evolution of subswarms and the global swarm, in turn, with subsolutions evaluated by local fitness functions and global solutions evaluated by a global fitness function. Extensive experiments on different networks show that NCD-CEA has a competitive performance in solving RAPs. This article advances toward controlling virus spreading over large-scale networks.

AB  - In the field of meteorology, radiosonde data and observation data are critical for analyzing regional meteorological characteristics. Because of the high false alarm rate, severe convection forecasting is still challenging. In addition, the existing methods are difficult to use to capture the interaction of meteorological factors at the same time. In this research, a cascade of extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) for feature transformation and a factorization machine (FM) for second-order feature interaction to capture the nonlinear interaction—XGB+FM—is proposed. An attention-based bidirectional long short-term memory (Att-Bi-LSTM) network is proposed to impute the missing data of meteorological observation stations. The problem of class imbalance is resolved by the support vector machines–synthetic minority oversampling technique (SVM-SMOTE), in which two oversampling strategies based on the support vector discrimination mechanism are proposed. It is proven that the method is effective, and the threat score (TS) is 7.27~14.28% higher than other methods. Moreover, we propose the meteorological factor selection method based on XGB+FM and improve the forecast accuracy, which is one of our contributions, as well as the forecast system.

AB  - The lack of evidence for new physics at the Large Hadron Collider so far has prompted the development of model-independent search techniques. In this study, we compare the anomaly scores of a variety of anomaly detection techniques: an isolation forest, a Gaussian mixture model, a static autoencoder, and a $\beta$-variational autoencoder (VAE), where we define the reconstruction loss of the latter as a weighted combination of regression and classification terms. We apply these algorithms to the 4-vectors of simulated LHC data, but also investigate the performance when the non-VAE algorithms are applied to the latent space variables created by the VAE. In addition, we assess the performance when the anomaly scores of these algorithms are combined in various ways. Using supersymmetric benchmark points, we find that the logical AND combination of the anomaly scores yielded from algorithms trained in the latent space of the VAE is the most effective discriminator of all methods tested.

AB  - <jats:p>In building management systems (BMS), a medium building may have between 200 and 1000 sensor points. Their labels need to be translated into a naming standard so they can be automatically recognised by the BMS platform. The current industrial practices often manually translate these points into labels (this is known as the tagging process), which takes around 8 hours for every 100 points. We introduce an AI-based multi-stage text classification that translates BMS points into formatted BMS labels. After comparing five different techniques for text classification (logistic regression, random forests, XGBoost, multinomial Naive Bayes and linear support vector classification), we demonstrate that XGBoost is the top performer with 90.29% of true positives, and use the prediction confidence to filter out false positives. This approach can be applied in sensors networks in various applications, where manual free-text data pre-processing remains cumbersome.</jats:p>

AB  - In recent years, the Internet of Things has played a dominant role in various real-time problems and given solutions via sensor signals. Monitoring the patient health status of Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) facilitates communication between wearable sensor devices and patients through a wireless network. Heart illness is one of the reasons for the increasing death rate in the world. Diagnosing the disease is done by the fusion of multi-sensor device signals. Much research has been done in predicting the disease and treating it correctly. However, the issues are accuracy, consumption time, and inefficiency. To overcome these issues, this paper proposed an efficient algorithm for fusing the multi-sensor signals from wearable sensor devices, classifying the medical signal data and predicting heart disease using the hybrid technique of kernel random forest with the Black Hole Optimization algorithm (KRF-BHO). This KRF-BHO is used for sensor data fusion, while XG-Boost is used to classify echocardiogram images. Accuracy in the training phase with multi-sensor data fusion data set of proposed work KRF-BHO with XGBoost classifier is 94.12%; in the testing phase, the accuracy rate is 95.89%. Similarly, for the Cleveland Dataset, the proposed work KRF-BHO with XGBoost classifier is 95.78%; in the testing phase, the accuracy rate is 96.21%.

AB  - Computational models for drug sensitivity prediction have the potential to revolutionise personalized cancer medicine. Drug sensitivity assays, as well as profiling of cancer cell lines and drugs becomes increasingly available for training such models. Machine learning methods for drug sensitivity prediction must be optimized for: (i) leveraging the wealth of information about both cancer cell lines and drugs, (ii) predictive performance and (iii) interpretability. Multiple methods were proposed for predicting drug sensitivity from cancer cell line features, some in a multi-task fashion. So far, no such model leveraged drug inhibition profiles. Recent neural network-based recommender systems arise as models capable of predicting cancer cell line response to drugs from their biological features with high prediction accuracy. These models, however, require a tailored approach to model interpretability. In this work, we develop a neural network recommender system for kinase inhibitor sensitivity prediction called DEERS. The model utilizes molecular features of the cancer cell lines and kinase inhibition profiles of the drugs. DEERS incorporates two autoencoders to project cell line and drug features into 10-dimensional hidden representations and a feed-forward neural network to combine them into response prediction. We propose a novel model interpretability approach offering the widest possible assessment of the specific genes and biological processes that underlie the action of the drugs on the cell lines. The approach considers also such genes and processes that were not included in the set of modeled features. Our approach outperforms simpler matrix factorization models, achieving R=0.82 correlation between true and predicted response for the unseen cell lines. Using the interpretability analysis, we evaluate correlation of all human genes with each of the hidden cell line dimensions. Subsequently, we identify 67 biological processes associated with these dimensions. Combined with drug response data, these associations point at the processes that drive the cell line sensitivity to particular compounds. Detailed case studies are shown for PHA-793887, XMD14-99 and Dabrafenib. Our framework provides an expressive, multitask neural network model with a custom interpretability approach for inferring underlying biological factors and explaining cancer cell response to drugs.

AB  - A major and demanding issue in the telecommunications industry is the prediction of churn customers. Churn describes the customer who is attrite from one Telecom service provider to competitors searching for better services offers. Companies from the Telco sector frequently have customer relationship management offices it is the main objective in how to win back defecting clients because preserve long-term customers can be much more beneficial to a company than gain newly recruited customers. Researchers and practitioners are paying great attention and investing more in developing a robust customer churn prediction model, especially in the telecommunication business by proposed numerous machine learning approaches. Many approaches of Classification are established, but the most effective in recent times is a tree-based method. The main contribution of this research is to predict churners/non-churners in the Telecom sector based on project pursuit Random Forest (PPForest) that uses discriminant feature analysis as a novelty extension of the conventional Random Forest approach for learning oblique Project Pursuit tree (PPtree). The proposed methodology leverages the advantage of two discriminant analysis methods to calculate the project index used in the construction of PPtree. The first method used Support Vector Machines (SVM) as a classifier in the construction of PPForest to differentiate between churners and non-churners customers. The second method is a Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) to achieve linear splitting of variables node during oblique PPtree construction to produce individual classifiers that are robust and more diverse than classical Random Forest. It found that the proposed methods enjoy the best performance measurements e.g. Accuracy, hit rate, ROC curve, Gini coefficient, Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic and lift coefficient, H-measure, AUC. Moreover, PPForest based on direct applied of LDA on the raw data delivers an effective evaluator for the customer churn prediction model.

AB  - Abstract An auditory stimulus can be related to the brain response that it evokes by a stimulus-response model fit to the data. This offers insight into perceptual processes within the brain and is also of potential use for devices such as Brain Computer Interfaces (BCI). The quality of the model can be quantified by measuring the fit with a regression problem, or by applying it to a classification task and measuring its performance. Here we focus on a match-mismatch (MM) task that entails deciding whether a segment of brain signal matches, via a model, the auditory stimulus that evoked it. The MM task allows stimulus-response models to be evaluated in the limit of very high model accuracy, making it an attractive alternative to the more commonly used task of auditory attention detection (AAD). The MM task does not require class labels, so it is immune to mislabeling, and it is applicable to data recorded in listening scenarios with only one sound source, thus it is cheap to obtain large quantities of training and testing data. Performance metrics from this task, associated with regression accuracy, provide complementary insights into the relation between stimulus and response, as well as information about discriminatory power directly applicable to BCI applications. Using these metrics, we describe a range of models of increasing complexity that we compare to methods in the literature, showing state-of-the-art performance. We document in detail one particular implementation, calibrated on a publicly-available database, that can serve as a robust reference to evaluate future developments.

AB  - Abstract Recent years have seen an increasing interest in Demand Response (DR), as a means to satisfy the growing flexibility needs of modern power grids. This increased flexibility is required due to the growing proportion of intermittent renewable energy generation into the energy mix, and increasing complexity in demand profiles from the electrification of transport networks. Currently, less than 2% of the global potential for demand-side flexibility is currently utilised, but a more widespread adoption of residential consumers as flexibility resources can lead to substantially higher utilisation of the demand-side flexibility potential. In order to achieve this target, acquiring a better understanding of how residential DR participants respond in DR events is essential – and recent advances in novel machine learning and statistical AI provide promising tools to address this challenge. This study provides an in-depth analysis of how residential customers have responded in incentive-based DR, utilising household-related data from a large-scale, real-world trial: the Smart Grid, Smart City (SGSC) project. Using a number of different machine learning approaches, we model the relationship between a household’s response and household-related features. Moreover, we examine the potential effects of households’ features on the residential response behaviour, and highlight a number of key insights which raise questions about the reported level of consumers’ engagement in DR schemes, and the motivation for different customers’ response level. Finally, we explore the temporal structure of the response – and although we found no supporting evidence of DR responders learning over time for the available data from this trial, the proposed methodologies could be used for longer-term longitudinal DR studies. Our study concludes with a broader discussion of our findings and potential paths for future research in this emerging area.

AB  - The Internet, which has spanned several networks in a broad range of domains, is having a significant impact on every aspect of our lives. The next generation of networks will utilize a wide variety of resources with significant sensing capabilities. Such networks will extend beyond physically linked computers to include multimodal-information from biological, cognitive, semantic, and social networks. This paradigm shift will involve symbiotic networks of smart medical devices, and smart phones or mobile personal computing and communication devices. These devices-and the network-will be constantly sensing, monitoring, and interpreting the environment; this is sometimes referred to as the Internet of Things (IoT). We are also witnessing considerable interest in the "Omics" paradigm, which can be viewed as the study of a domain in a massive scale, at different levels of abstraction, in an integrative manner. The IoT revolution, combined with the Omics revolution (genomics and socio-omics or social networks) and artificial intelligence resurgence, will have significant implications for the way health care is delivered in the United States. After discussing a vision for health care in the future, we introduce the P9 health care concept, followed by a discussion of a framework for smart health care. Then, we present a case study and research directions, followed by examples of ongoing work at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).

AB  - <jats:p>Digitalization and decentralization of energy supply have introduced several challenges to emerging power grids known as smart grids. One of the significant challenges, on the demand side, is preserving the stability of the power systems due to locally distributed energy sources such as micro-power generation and storage units among energy prosumers at the household and community levels. In this context, energy prosumers are defined as energy consumers who also generate, store and trade energy. Accurate predictions of energy supply and electric demand of prosuemrs can address the stability issues at local levels. This study aims to develop appropriate forecasting frameworks for such environments to preserve power stability. Building on existing work on energy forecasting at low-aggregated levels, it asks: What factors influence most on consumption and generation patterns of residential customers as energy prosumers. It also investigates how the accuracy of forecasting models at the household and community levels can be improved. Based on a review of the literature on energy forecasting and per- forming empirical study on real datasets, the forecasting frameworks were developed focusing on short-term prediction horizons. These frameworks are built upon predictive analytics including data col- lection, data analysis, data preprocessing, and predictive machine learning algorithms based on statistical learning, artificial neural networks and deep learning. Analysis of experimental results demonstrated that load observa- tions from previous hours (lagged loads) along with air temperature and time variables highly affects the households’ consumption and generation behaviour. The results also indicate that the prediction accuracy of adopted machine learning techniques can be improved by feeding them with highly influential variables and appliance-level data as well as by combining multiple learning algorithms ranging from conventional to deep neural networks. Further research is needed to investigate online approaches that could strengthen the effectiveness of forecasting in time-sensitive energy environments.</jats:p>

AB  - <b>Background:</b> Cataract is the leading cause of blindness worldwide. In order to achieve large-scale cataract screening and remarkable performance, several studies have applied artificial intelligence (AI) to cataract detection based on fundus images. However, the fundus images they used are original from normal optical circumstances, which is less impractical due to the existence of poor-quality fundus images for inappropriate optical conditions in actual scenarios. Furthermore, these poor-quality images are easily mistaken as cataracts because both show fuzzy imaging characteristics, which may decline the performance of cataract detection. Therefore, we aimed to develop and validate an antiinterference AI model for rapid and efficient diagnosis based on fundus images. <b>Materials and Methods:</b> The datasets (including both cataract and noncataract labels) were derived from the Chinese PLA general hospital. The antiinterference AI model consisted of two AI submodules, a quality recognition model for cataract labeling and a convolutional neural networks-based model for cataract classification. The quality recognition model was performed to distinguish poor-quality images from normal-quality images and further generate the pseudo labels related to image quality for noncataract. Through this, the original binary-class label (cataract and noncataract) was adjusted to three categories (cataract, noncataract with normal-quality images, and noncataract with poor-quality images), which could be used to guide the model to distinguish cataract from suspected cataract fundus images. In the cataract classification stage, the convolutional-neural-network-based model was proposed to classify cataracts based on the label of the previous stage. The performance of the model was internally validated and externally tested in real-world settings, and the evaluation indicators included area under the receiver operating curve (AUC), accuracy (ACC), sensitivity (SEN), and specificity (SPE). <b>Results:</b> In the internal and external validation, the antiinterference AI model showed robust performance in cataract diagnosis (three classifications with AUCs >91%, ACCs >84%, SENs >71%, and SPEs >89%). Compared with the model that was trained on the binary-class label, the antiinterference cataract model improved its performance by 10%. <b>Conclusion:</b> We proposed an efficient antiinterference AI model for cataract diagnosis, which could achieve accurate cataract screening even with the interference of poor-quality images and help the government formulate a more accurate aid policy.

AB  - <jats:p>Futures markets offer investors many attractive advantages, including high leverage, high liquidity, fair, and fast returns. Highly leveraged positions and big contract sizes, on the other hand, expose investors to the risk of massive losses from even minor market changes. Among the numerous stock market forecasting tools, deep learning has recently emerged as a favorite tool in the research community. This study presents an approach for applying deep learning models to predict the monthly average of the Taiwan Capitalization Weighted Stock Index (TAIEX) to support decision-making in trading Mini-TAIEX futures (MTX). We inspected many global financial and economic factors to find the most valuable predictor variables for the TAIEX, and we examined three different deep learning architectures for building prediction models. A simulation on trading MTX was then performed with a simple trading strategy and two different stop-loss strategies to show the effectiveness of the models. We found that the Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) performed better than other models, including the two baselines, i.e., linear regression and extreme gradient boosting. Moreover, stop-loss strategies are necessary, and a simple one could be sufficient to reduce a severe loss effectively.</jats:p>

AB  - The current pandemic has significantly impacted educational practices, modifying many aspects of how and when we learn. In particular, remote learning and the use of digital platforms have greatly increased in importance. Online teaching and e-learning provide many benefits for information retention and schedule flexibility in our on-demand world while breaking down barriers caused by geographic location, physical facilities, transportation issues, or physical impediments. However, educators and researchers have noticed that students face a learning and performance decline as a result of this sudden shift to online teaching and e-learning from classrooms around the world. In this paper, we focus on reviewing eye-tracking techniques and systems, data collection and management methods, datasets, and multi-modal learning data analytics for promoting pervasive and proactive learning in educational environments. We then describe and discuss the crucial challenges and open issues of current learning environments and data learning methods. The review and discussion show the potential of transforming traditional ways of teaching and learning in the classroom, and the feasibility of adaptively driving learning processes using eye-tracking, data science, multimodal learning analytics, and artificial intelligence. These findings call for further attention and research on collaborative and intelligent learning systems, plug-and-play devices and software modules, data science, and learning analytics methods for promoting the evolution of face-to-face learning and e-learning environments and enhancing student collaboration, engagement, and success.

AB  - <jats:p>For many applications deployed in manufacturing networks, communication latency has been a significant barrier. Despite the constant development of improved communication protocols and standards during Industry 4.0, the latency problem persists, lowering quality of services (QoS) and quality of experience (QoE). Tactile internet (TI), with its high availability, security, and ultra-low latency, will add a new dimension to human-machine interaction (HMI) by enabling haptic and tactile sensations. The tactile internet (TI) is a cutting-edge technology that uses 5G and beyond (B5G) communications to enable real-time interaction of haptic data over the internet between tactile ends. This emerging TI technology is regarded as the next evolutionary step for the Internet of Things (IoT) and is expected to bring about massive changes towards Society 5.0 and to address complex issues in current society. To that end, the 5G mobile communication systems will support the TI at the wireless edge. As a result, TI can be used as a backbone for delay mitigation in conjunction with 5G networks, allowing for ultra-reliable low latency applications like Smart Manufacturing, virtual reality, and augmented reality. Consequently, the purpose of this paper is to present the current state of 5G and TI, as well as the challenges and future trends for 5G networks beyond 2021, as well as a conceptual framework for integrating 5G and TI into existing industrial case studies, with a focus on the design aspects and layers of TI, such as the master, network, and slave layers. Finally, the key publications focused on the key enabling technologies of TI are summarized and the beyond 5G era towards Society 5.0 based on cyber-physical systems is discussed.</jats:p>

AB  - <jats:p>It is of great theoretical and practical significance to understand the inherent relationship and evolution patterns among various environmental factors in the oceans. In this study, we used scientific data obtained by the Tara Oceans Project to conduct a comprehensive correlation analysis of marine environmental factors. Using artificial intelligence and machine learning methods, we evaluated different methods of modeling and predicting chlorophyll a (Chl-a) concentrations at the surface water layer of selected Tara Oceans data after the raw data processing. Then, a Pearson correlation and characteristic importance analysis between marine environmental factors and the Chl-a concentrations was conducted, and thus a comprehensive correlation model for environmental factors was established. With these obtained data, we developed a new prediction model for the Chl-a abundance based on the eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) algorithm with intelligent parameter optimization strategy. The proposed model was used to analyze and predict the abundance of Chl-a abundance of TOP. The obtained predicted results were also compared with those by using other three widely-used machine learning methods including the random forest (RF), support vector regression (SVR) and linear regression (LR) algorithms. Our results show that the proposed comprehensive correlation evaluation model can identify the effective features closely related to Chl-a, abundance, and the prediction model can reveal the potential relationship between environmental factors and the Chl-a concentrations in the oceans.</jats:p>

AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>This paper presents a task allocation strategy for a multi-robot system with a human supervisor. The multi-robot system consists of a team of heterogeneous robots with different capabilities that operate in a dynamic scenario that can change in the robots’ capabilities or in the operational requirements. The human supervisor can intervene in the operation scenario by approving the final plan before its execution or forcing a robot to execute a specific task. The proposed task allocation strategy leverages an auction-based method in combination with a sampling-based multi-goal motion planning. The latter is used to evaluate the costs of execution of tasks based on realistic features of paths. The proposed architecture enables the allocation of tasks accounting for priorities and precedence constraints, as well as the quick re-allocation of tasks after a dynamic perturbation occurs –a crucial feature when the human supervisor preempts the outcome of the algorithm and makes manual adjustments. An extensive simulation campaign in a rescue scenario validates our approach in dynamic scenarios comprising a sensor failure of a robot, a total failure of a robot, and a human-driven re-allocation. We highlight the benefits of the proposed multi-goal strategy by comparing it with single-goal motion planning strategies at the state of the art. Finally, we provide evidence for the system efficiency by demonstrating the powerful synergistic combination of the auction-based allocation and the multi-goal motion planning approach.</jats:p>

          <jats:p>Assessing team performance in association football (commonly known as football or soccer) is challenging due to the sport’s low-scoring nature and inherent unpredictability. While evaluating strategies based on space control and the creation of open spaces has been explored in the literature, the temporal aspect of space availability for the ball carrier remains under-explored. This work introduces a novel time-series performance evaluation metric, Ball Carrier Open Space (<jats:bold>

Additionally, it presents a novel approach to quantify open space for the ball carrier using player data extracted from television footage. This work discuss on <jats:bold>

AB  - The importance of anticorrosive coatings cannot be overstated, as they play a vital role in safeguarding assets and infrastructure across various industries. Within this context, the emergence of waterborne (WB) coatings stands out for their paramount significance, offering a sustainable alternative to traditional solvent-based (SB) coatings and addressing pressing environmental concerns. Despite their eco-friendliness, the complexity of their film formation mechanism and the lack of understanding present challenges in enhancing the performance of waterborne coatings for corrosion protection. These coatings are created by dispersing polymers in water, which then form a protective film on a substrate. The process involves stages like water evaporation, particle packing, and polymer interdiffusion, often leading to films with defects and inferior protection against extremely corrosive environments compared to SB coatings. This Review scrutinizes the interplay of factors affecting film formation in application, including coalescing agents, environmental factors, and application conditions. A comparative analysis between SB and WB coatings is also featured to shed light on the performance gap under harsh conditions. This Review discusses analytical techniques for studying film formation, aiming to guide future research toward improving WB coatings' durability and effectiveness. In compiling this collective wisdom, this Review emphasizes the translation of theoretical understanding into practical knowledge, equipping formulators with actionable insights to optimize WB coatings for real-world application and performance.

AB  - Real-time X-ray tomography pipelines, such as implemented by RECAST3D, compute and visualize tomographic reconstructions in milliseconds, and enable the observation of dynamic experiments in synchrotron beamlines and laboratory scanners. For extending real-time reconstruction by image processing and analysis components, Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are a promising technology, due to their strong performance and much faster run-times compared to conventional algorithms. DNNs may prevent experiment repetition by simplifying real-time steering and optimization of the ongoing experiment. The main challenge of integrating DNNs into real-time tomography pipelines, however, is that they need to learn their task from representative data before the start of the experiment. In scientific environments, such training data may not exist, and other uncertain and variable factors, such as the set-up configuration, reconstruction parameters, or user interaction, cannot easily be anticipated beforehand, either. To overcome these problems, we developed just-in-time learning, an online DNN training strategy that takes advantage of the spatio-temporal continuity of consecutive reconstructions in the tomographic pipeline. This allows training and deploying comparatively small DNNs during the experiment. We provide software implementations, and study the feasibility and challenges of the approach by training the self-supervised Noise2Inverse denoising task with X-ray data replayed from real-world dynamic experiments.

AB  - Limited quantum memory is one of the most important constraints for near-term quantum devices. Understanding whether a small quantum computer can simulate a larger quantum system, or execute an algorithm requiring more qubits than available, is both of theoretical and practical importance. In this Letter, we introduce cluster parameters K and d of a quantum circuit. The tensor network of such a circuit can be decomposed into clusters of size at most d with at most K qubits of inter-cluster quantum communication. We propose a cluster simulation scheme that can simulate any (K,d)-clustered quantum circuit on a d-qubit machine in time roughly 2^{O(K)}, with further speedups possible when taking more fine-grained circuit structure into account. We show how our scheme can be used to simulate clustered quantum systems-such as large molecules-that can be partitioned into multiple significantly smaller clusters with weak interactions among them. By using a suitable clustered ansatz, we also experimentally demonstrate that a quantum variational eigensolver can still achieve the desired performance for estimating the energy of the BeH_{2} molecule while running on a physical quantum device with half the number of required qubits.

AB  - 1 Abstract Cells react to their microenvironment by integrating external stimuli into phenotypic decisions via an intracellular signaling network. Even cells with deregulated signaling can adapt to their environment. To analyze the interplay of environment, neighborhood, and cell state on phenotypic variability, we developed an experimental approach that enables multiplexed mass cytometric imaging to analyze up to 240 pooled spheroid microtissues. This system allowed us to quantify the contributions of environment, neighborhood, and intracellular state to phenotypic variability in spheroid cells. A linear model explained on average more than half of the variability of 34 markers across four cell lines and six growth conditions. We found that the contributions of cell-intrinsic and environmental factors are hierarchically interdependent. By overexpression of 51 signaling protein constructs in subsets of cells, we identified proteins that have cell-intrinsic and extrinsic effects, exemplifying how cell states depend on the cellular neighborhood in spheroid culture. Our study deconvolves factors influencing cellular phenotype in a 3D tissue and provides a scalable experimental system, analytical principles, and rich multiplexed imaging datasets for future studies.

AB  - <jats:p> Progressive passing in football (soccer) is a key aspect in creating positive possession outcomes. Whilst this is well established, there is not a consistent way to describe the different types of progressive passes. We expand on the previous literature, providing a complete methodological approach to progressive pass clustering from selection of the number of clusters (k) to risk-reward profiling of these progressive pass types. In this paper the Separation and Concordance (SeCo) framework is utilised to provide a process to analyse k-means clustering solutions in a more repeatable way. The results demonstrate that we can find stable progressive pass clusters in International Football and their efficacy with progressive passes “Mid Central to Mid Half Space” in build-up and “Mid Half Space to Final Central” into the final 3rd having the best balance between risk (turnover) and reward (shot created) in the subsequent possession. This allowed for opposition profiling of player and team patterns in different phases of play, with a case study presented for the teams in the Last 16 of the 2022 World Cup. </jats:p>

AB  - Bone marrow transplant (BMT) is an effective surgical treatment for bone marrow-related disorders. However, several associated risk factors can impair long-term survival after BMT. Machine learning (ML) technologies have been proven useful in survival prediction of BMT receivers along with the influences that limit their resilience. In this study, an efficient classification model predicting the survival of children undergoing BMT is presented using a public dataset. Several supervised ML methods were investigated in this regard with an 80-20 train-test split ratio. To ensure prediction with minimal time and resources, only the top 11 out of the 59 dataset features were considered using Chi-square feature selection method. Furthermore, hyperparameter optimization (HPO) using the grid search cross-validation (GSCV) technique was adopted to increase the accuracy of prediction. Four experiments were conducted utilizing a combination of default and optimized hyperparameters on the original and reduced datasets. Our investigation revealed that the top 11 features of HPO had the same prediction accuracy (94.73%) as the entire dataset with default parameters, however, requiring minimal time and resources. Hence, the proposed approach may aid in the development of a computer-aided diagnostic system with satisfactory accuracy and minimal computation time by utilizing medical data records.

AB  - Optimisation problems are ubiquitous in particle and astrophysics, and involve locating the optimum of a complicated function of many parameters that may be computationally expensive to evaluate. We describe a number of global optimisation algorithms that are not yet widely used in particle astrophysics, benchmark them against random sampling and existing techniques, and perform a detailed comparison of their performance on a range of test functions. These include four analytic test functions of varying dimensionality, and a realistic example derived from a recent global fit of weak-scale supersymmetry. Although the best algorithm to use depends on the function being investigated, we are able to present general conclusions about the relative merits of random sampling, Differential Evolution, Particle Swarm Optimisation, the Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy, Bayesian Optimisation, Grey Wolf Optimisation, and the PyGMO Artificial Bee Colony, Gaussian Particle Filter and Adaptive Memory Programming for Global Optimisation algorithms.

AB  - Metabolism plays a central role in evolution, as resource conservation is a selective pressure for fitness and survival. Resource-driven adaptations offer a good model to study evolutionary innovation more broadly. It remains unknown how resource-driven optimization of genome function integrates chromatin architecture with transcriptional phase transitions. Here we show that tuning of genome architecture and heterotypic transcriptional condensates mediate resilience to nutrient limitation. Network genomic integration of phenotypic, structural, and functional relationships reveals that fat tissue promotes organismal adaptations through metabolic acceleration chromatin domains and heterotypic PGC1A condensates. We find evolutionary innovation in several dimensions; low conservation of amino acid residues within protein disorder regions, nonrandom chromatin location of metabolic acceleration domains, condensate-chromatin stability through cis-regulatory archoring and encoding of genome plasticity in radial chromatin organization. We show that environmental tuning of these adaptations leads to fasting endurance, through efficient nuclear compartmentalization of lipid metabolic regions, and, locally, human-specific burst kinetics of lipid cycling genes. This process reduces oxidative stress, and fatty-acid mediated cellular acidification, enabling endurance of condensate chromatin conformations. Comparative genomics of genetic and diet perturbations reveal mammalian convergence of phenotype and structural relationships, along with loss of transcriptional control by diet-induced obesity. Further, we find that radial transcriptional organization is encoded in functional divergence of metabolic disease variant-hubs, heterotypic condensate composition, and evolutionary tuned protein residues sensing metabolic variation. During fuel restriction, these features license the formation of large heterotypic condensates that buffer proton excess, and shift viscoelasticity for condensate endurance. This mechanism maintains physiological pH, reduces pH-resilient inflammatory gene programs, and enables genome plasticity through transcriptionally driven cell-specific chromatin contacts. In vivo manipulation of this circuit promotes fasting-like adaptations with heterotypic nuclear compartments, metabolic and cell-specific homeostasis. In sum, we uncover here a general principle by which transcription uses environmental fluctuations for genome function, and demonstrate how resource conservation optimizes transcriptional self-organization through robust feedback integrators, highlighting obesity as an inhibitor of genome plasticity relevant for many diseases.

AB  - Automated ECG classification is a standard feature in many commercial 12-Lead ECG machines. As part of the Physionet/CinC Challenge 2020, our team, “Mad-hardmax”, developed an XGBoost based classification method for the analysis of 12-Lead ECGs acquired from four different countries. Our aim is to develop an interpretable classifier that outputs diagnoses which can be traced to specific ECG features, while also testing the potential of information theoretic features for ECG diagnosis. These measures capture high-level interdependencies across ECG leads which are effective for discriminating conditions with multiple complex morphologies. On unseen test data, our algorithm achieved a challenge score of 0.155 relative to a winning score of 0.533, putting our submission in 24th position from 41 successful entries.

AB  - In response to climate change and continued reliance on traditional high-carbon fossil fuels, promoting the transition towards sustainable energy systems by development of low-carbon energy resources has been seen as the main strategy for mitigating and solving global climate change. However, the promotion of low-carbon energy also faces material supply risks. To provide a reference for the steady and rapid development of renewable energy and other energy in the future energy market, this paper considers renewable energy prediction based on an LSTM model as well as the growth rate changes of crude oil, natural gas, nuclear energy, financial revenues and expenditure. In the prediction process, it is found that natural gas will be a strong competitor for the development of renewable energy in the future. When natural gas grows too quickly, the growth of renewable energy will be negative. On the other hand, when the monthly growth rate of natural gas and crude oil is smaller than that of nuclear energy, renewable energy will display a growth trend, and the rate will increase with the growth of natural gas and nuclear energy. What’s more, wind and solar energy will be limited by metallic materials, such as Dy, Nd, Te, In, etc. Improving the energy density of metals plays a key role in China's transition to a low-carbon energy structure.

AB  - <jats:p>The work of forecasting solar power is becoming more crucial with directives to regulate the quality of the power and increase the system’s reliability as photovoltaic (PV) sites are being integrated into the architecture of power systems at an increasing rate. This study proposes a metaheuristic model for short-term photovoltaic power forecasting that includes shuffled frog leaping algorithm (SFLA), principal component analysis (PCA), and generalized regression neural network (GRNN). In this model, GRNN is implemented to analyze the input parameters after the dimension reduction process, and its parameters get optimized with the help of the SFLA, which has the advantage of fast convergence speed as well as searching ability, whereas PCA techniques are implemented to diminish the dimension of meteorological conditions. This hybrid model achieves day-ahead short-term forecasting, as shown in an experimental case of a Bhadla Solar Park installed in Gujarat, India. The accuracy of the proposed model obtained a mean absolute error (nMAE) of 2.3325, and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 129.425. Similarly, the error in forecasting obtained by the proposed method results in nMAE = 2.977 and RMSE = 160.92. The output results obtained surpassed all other hybrid models used for comparison in this study.</jats:p>

AB  - Formulation strategies are vital in drug development, but trial-and-error optimization of critical parameters is inefficient. Artificial Intelligence (AI) addresses this by enabling data-driven decision-making. AI has emerged as a pivotal tool in drug discovery, formulation, and development. This manuscript explores the significant applications of AI in various aspects of liquid dosage form manufacturing, aligned with Industry 5.0 principles. This integration seeks to enhance productivity, monitor and modify development processes, enable human-centric automation, improve product quality, and optimize industry workflows. Essential steps in developmental design include solvent selection, drug-excipient compatibility, crystallinity, salt formation, permeability, and stability. This technological approach facilitates rapid decision-making and ensures batch-to-batch consistency by investigating major attrition rates in manufacturing and discovery. We highlight the utilization of AI tools and techniques alongside Process Analytical Technology (PAT) for real-time applications in the production of parenteral solutions, suspensions, emulsions, and other liquid forms. A comprehensive review of the current state of AI in common manufacturing steps involved in liquid dosage formulation development is provided, identifying potential research gaps. We discuss ongoing challenges, propose realistic strategies to address these challenges and outline future research directions. Graphical Abstract

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a chronic progressive neurodegenerative disease that often occurs in the elderly. Electroencephalography (EEG) signals have a strong correlation with neuropsychological test results and brain structural changes. It has become an effective aid in the early diagnosis of AD by exploiting abnormal brain activity. Because the original EEG has the characteristics of weak amplitude, strong background noise and randomness, the research on intelligent AD recognition based on machine learning is still in the exploratory stage. This paper proposes the discriminant subspace low-rank representation (DSLRR) algorithm for EEG-based AD and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) recognition. The subspace learning and low-rank representation are flexibly integrated into a feature representation model. On the one hand, based on the low-rank representation, the graph discriminant embedding is introduced to constrain the representation coefficients, so that the robust representation coefficients can preserve the local manifold structure of the EEG data. On the other hand, the least squares regression, principle component analysis, and global graph embedding are introduced into the subspace learning, to make the model more discriminative. The objective function of DSLRR is solved by the inexact augmented Lagrange multiplier method. The experimental results show that the DSLRR algorithm has good classification performance, which is helpful for in-depth research on AD and MCI recognition.

AB  - <AbstractText Label="BACKGROUND">Spasticity is defined as "a motor disorder characterised by a velocity dependent increase in tonic stretch reflexes (muscle tone) with exaggerated tendon jerks". It is a highly prevalent condition following stroke and other neurological conditions. Clinical assessment of spasticity relies predominantly on manual, non-instrumented, clinical scales. Technology based solutions have been developed in the last decades to offer more specific, sensitive and accurate alternatives but no consensus exists on these different approaches.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="METHOD">A systematic review of literature of technology-based methods aiming at the assessment of spasticity was performed. The approaches taken in the studies were classified based on the method used as well as their outcome measures. The psychometric properties and usability of the methods and outcome measures reported were evaluated.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="RESULTS">124 studies were included in the analysis. 78 different outcome measures were identified, among which seven were used in more than 10 different studies each. The different methods rely on a wide range of different equipment (from robotic systems to simple goniometers) affecting their cost and usability. Studies equivalently applied to the lower and upper limbs (48% and 52%, respectively). A majority of studies applied to a stroke population (N = 79). More than half the papers did not report thoroughly the psychometric properties of the measures. Analysis identified that only 54 studies used measures specific to spasticity. Repeatability and discriminant validity were found to be of good quality in respectively 25 and 42 studies but were most often not evaluated (N = 95 and N = 78). Clinical validity was commonly assessed only against clinical scales (N = 33). Sensitivity of the measure was assessed in only three studies.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="CONCLUSION">The development of a large diversity of assessment approaches appears to be done at the expense of their careful evaluation. Still, among the well validated approaches, the ones based on manual stretching and measuring a muscle activity reaction and the ones leveraging controlled stretches while isolating the stretch-reflex torque component appear as the two promising practical alternatives to clinical scales. These methods should be further evaluated, including on their sensitivity, to fully inform on their potential.</AbstractText>

AB  - The path planning of a ship requires much information, and one of the essential factors is predicting the ocean environment. Ocean weather can generally be gathered from forecasting information provided by weather centers. However, these data are difficult to obtain when satellite communication is unstable during voyages, or there are cases where forecast data for a more extended period of time are needed for the operation of the fleet. Therefore, shipping companies and classification societies have attempted to establish a model for predicting the ocean weather on its own. Historically, ocean weather has been primarily predicted using empirical and numerical methods. Recently, a method for predicting ocean weather using deep learning has emerged. In this study, a deep learning model combining a denoising AutoEncoder and convolutional long short-term memory (LSTM) was proposed to predict the ocean weather worldwide. The denoising AutoEncoder is effective for removing noise that hinders the training of deep learning models. While the LSTM could be used as time-series inputs at specific points, the convolutional LSTM can use time-series images as inputs, making them suitable for predicting a wide range of ocean weather. Herein, using the proposed model, eight parameters of ocean weather were predicted. The proposed learning model predicted ocean weather after one week, showing an average error of 6.7%. The results show the applicability of the proposed learning model for predicting ocean weather.

AB  - Many medical and biological protocols for analyzing individual biological cells involve morphological evaluation based on cell staining, designed to enhance imaging contrast and enable clinicians and biologists to differentiate between various cell organelles. However, cell staining is not always allowed in certain medical procedures. In other cases, staining may be time-consuming or expensive to implement. Staining protocols may be operator-sensitive, and hence may lead to varying analytical results, as well as cause artificial imaging artifacts or false heterogeneity. We present a deep-learning approach, called HoloStain, which converts images of isolated biological cells acquired without staining by holographic microscopy to their virtually stained images. We demonstrate this approach for human sperm cells, as there is a well-established protocol and global standardization for characterizing the morphology of stained human sperm cells for fertility evaluation, but, on the other hand, staining might be cytotoxic and thus is not allowed during human in vitro fertilization (IVF). After a training process, the deep neural network can take images of unseen sperm cells retrieved from holograms acquired without staining and convert them to their stainlike images. We obtained a fivefold recall improvement in the analysis results, demonstrating the advantage of using virtual staining for sperm cell analysis. With the introduction of simple holographic imaging methods in clinical settings, the proposed method has a great potential to become a common practice in human IVF procedures, as well as to significantly simplify and radically change other cell analyses and techniques such as imaging flow cytometry.

AB  - This paper describes a novel design of a neural network-based speech generation model for learning prosodic representation.The problem of representation learning is formulated according to the information bottleneck (IB) principle. A modified VQ-VAE quantized layer is incorporated in the speech generation model to control the IB capacity and adjust the balance between reconstruction power and disentangle capability of the learned representation. The proposed model is able to learn word-level prosodic representations from speech data. With an optimized IB capacity, the learned representations not only are adequate to reconstruct the original speech but also can be used to transfer the prosody onto different textual content. Extensive results of the objective and subjective evaluation are presented to demonstrate the effect of IB capacity control, the effectiveness, and potential usage of the learned prosodic representation in controllable neural speech generation.

AB  - <jats:p>Background: Fraud in financial transaction is at the root of corruption issues recorded in organization. Detecting fraud practices has become increasingly complex and challenging. As a result, auditors require precise analytical tools for fraud detection. Grouping financial transaction data using K-Means Clustering algorithm can enhance the efficiency of applying Benford Law for optimal fraud detection.
Objective: This study aimed to introduce Multiple Benford Law Model for the analysis of data to show potential concealed fraud in the audited organization financial transaction. The data was categorized into low, medium, and high transaction values using K-Means Clustering algorithm. Subsequently, it was reanalyzed through Multiple Benford Law Model in a specialized fraud analysis tool.
Methods: In this study, the experimental procedures of Multiple Benford Law Model designed for public sector organizations were applied. The analysis of suspected fraud generated by the toolkit was compared with the actual conditions reported in audit report. The financial transaction dataset was prepared and grouped into three distinct clusters using the Euclidean distance equation. Data in these clusters was analyzed using Benford Law, comparing the frequency of the first digit’s occurrence to the expected frequency based on Benford Law. Significant deviations exceeding ±5% were considered potential areas for further scrutiny in audit. Furthermore, the analysis were validated by cross-referencing the result with the findings presented in the authorized audit organization report.
Results: Multiple Benford Law Model developed was incorporated into an audit toolkit to automated calculations based on Benford Law. Furthermore, the datasets were categorized using K-Means Clustering algorithm into three clusters representing low, medium, and high-value transaction data. Results from the application of Benford Law showed a 40.00% potential for fraud detection. However, when using Multiple Benford Law Model and dividing the data into three clusters, fraud detection accuracy increased to 93.33%. The comparative results in audit report indicated a 75.00% consistency with the actual events or facts discovered.
Conclusion: The use of Multiple Benford Law Model in audit toolkit substantially improved the accuracy of detecting potential fraud in financial transaction. Validation through audit report showed the conformity between the identified fraud practices and the detected financial transaction.

AB  - <AbstractText Label="BACKGROUND" NlmCategory="BACKGROUND">Smoking is a critical risk factor responsible for over eight million annual deaths worldwide. It is essential to obtain information on smoking habits to advance research and implement preventive measures such as screening of high-risk individuals. In most countries, including Denmark, smoking habits are not systematically recorded and at best documented within unstructured free-text segments of electronic health records (EHRs). This would require researchers and clinicians to manually navigate through extensive amounts of unstructured data, which is one of the main reasons that smoking habits are rarely integrated into larger studies. Our aim is to develop machine learning models to classify patients' smoking status from their EHRs.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="METHODS" NlmCategory="METHODS">This study proposes an efficient natural language processing (NLP) pipeline capable of classifying patients' smoking status and providing explanations for the decisions. The proposed NLP pipeline comprises four distinct components, which are; (1) considering preprocessing techniques to address abbreviations, punctuation, and other textual irregularities, (2) four cutting-edge feature extraction techniques, i.e. Embedding, BERT, Word2Vec, and Count Vectorizer, employed to extract the optimal features, (3) utilization of a Stacking-based Ensemble (SE) model and a Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory Neural Network (CNN-LSTM) for the identification of smoking status, and (4) application of a local interpretable model-agnostic explanation to explain the decisions rendered by the detection models. The EHRs of 23,132 patients with suspected lung cancer were collected from the Region of Southern Denmark during the period 1/1/2009-31/12/2018. A medical professional annotated the data into 'Smoker' and 'Non-Smoker' with further classifications as 'Active-Smoker', 'Former-Smoker', and 'Never-Smoker'. Subsequently, the annotated dataset was used for the development of binary and multiclass classification models. An extensive comparison was conducted of the detection performance across various model architectures.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="RESULTS">The results of experimental validation confirm the consistency among the models. However, for binary classification, BERT method with CNN-LSTM architecture outperformed other models by achieving precision, recall, and F1-scores between 97% and 99% for both Never-Smokers and Active-Smokers. In multiclass classification, the Embedding technique with CNN-LSTM architecture yielded the most favorable results in class-specific evaluations, with equal performance measures of 97% for Never-Smoker and measures in the range of 86 to 89% for Active-Smoker and 91-92% for Never-Smoker.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="CONCLUSION" NlmCategory="CONCLUSIONS">Our proposed NLP pipeline achieved a high level of classification performance. In addition, we presented the explanation of the decision made by the best performing detection model. Future work will expand the model's capabilities to analyze longer notes and a broader range of categories to maximize its utility in further research and screening applications.</AbstractText>

AB  - Cell-to-cell variability generates subpopulations of drug-tolerant cells that diminish the efficacy of cancer drugs. Efficacious combination therapies are thus needed to block drug-tolerant cells via minimizing the impact of heterogeneity. Probabilistic models such as Bliss independence have been developed to evaluate drug interactions and their combination efficacy based on probabilities of specific actions mediated by drugs individually and in combination. In practice, however, these models are often applied to conventional dose-response curves in which a normalized parameter with a value between zero and one, generally referred to as fraction of cells affected (fa), is used to evaluate the efficacy of drugs and their combined interactions. We use basic probability theory, computer simulations, time-lapse live cell microscopy, and single-cell analysis to show that fa metrics may bias our assessment of drug efficacy and combination effectiveness. This bias may be corrected when dynamic probabilities of drug-induced phenotypic events, i.e. induction of cell death and inhibition of division, at a single-cell level are used as metrics to assess drug efficacy. Probabilistic phenotype metrics offer the following three benefits. First, in contrast to the commonly used fa metrics, they directly represent probabilities of drug action in a cell population. Therefore, they deconvolve differential degrees of drug effect on tumor cell killing versus inhibition of cell division, which may not be correlated for many drugs. Second, they increase the sensitivity of short-term drug response assays to cell-to-cell heterogeneities and the presence of drug-tolerant subpopulations. Third, their probabilistic nature allows them to be used directly in unbiased evaluation of synergistic efficacy in drug combinations using probabilistic models such as Bliss independence. Altogether, we envision that probabilistic analysis of single-cell phenotypes complements currently available assays via improving our understanding of heterogeneity in drug response, thereby facilitating the discovery of more efficacious combination therapies to block drug-tolerant cells.

AB  - <jats:p>The techniques for forecasting meteorological variables are highly studied since prior knowledge of them allows for the efficient management of renewable energies, and also for other applications of science such as agriculture, health, engineering, energy, etc. In this research, the design, implementation, and comparison of forecasting models for meteorological variables have been performed using different Machine Learning techniques as part of Python open-source software. The techniques implemented include multiple linear regression, polynomial regression, random forest, decision tree, XGBoost, and multilayer perceptron neural network (MLP). To identify the best technique, the mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), mean absolute error (MAE), and coefficient of determination (R2) are used as evaluation metrics. The most efficient techniques depend on the variable to be forecasting, however, it is noted that for most of them, random forest and XGBoost techniques present better performance. For temperature, the best performing technique was Random Forest with an R2 of 0.8631, MAE of 0.4728 °C, MAPE of 2.73%, and RMSE of 0.6621 °C; for relative humidity, was Random Forest with an R2 of 0.8583, MAE of 2.1380RH, MAPE of 2.50% and RMSE of 2.9003 RH; for solar radiation, was Random Forest with an R2 of 0.7333, MAE of 65.8105 W/m2, and RMSE of 105.9141 W/m2; and for wind speed, was Random Forest with an R2 of 0.3660, MAE of 0.1097 m/s, and RMSE of 0.2136 m/s.</jats:p>

AB  - <jats:p>Manufacturing companies rely on technical drawings to develop new designs or adapt designs to customer preferences. The database of historical and novel technical drawings thus represents the knowledge that is core to their operations. With current methods, however, utilizing these drawings is mostly a manual and time consuming effort. In this work, we present a software tool that knows how to interpret various parts of the drawing and can translate this information to allow for automatic reasoning and machine  learning  on top of such a large database of technical drawings. For example, to find erroneous designs, to learn about patterns present in successful designs, etc. To achieve this, we propose a method that automatically learns a parser capable of interpreting technical drawings, using only limited expert interaction. The proposed method makes use of both neural methods and symbolic  methods.  Neural methods to interpret visual images and recognize parts of two-dimensional drawings. Symbolic methods to deal with the relational structure and understand the data encapsulated in complex tables present in the technical drawing. Furthermore, the output can be used, for example, to build a similarity based search algorithm. We showcase one deployed tool that is used to help engineers find relevant, previous designs more easily as they can now query the database using a partial design instead of through limited and tedious keyword searches. A partial design can be a part of the two-dimensional  drawing, part of a table,  part of  the  contained textual information, or combinations thereof.</jats:p>

AB  - Android devices are popularly available in the commercial market at different price levels for various levels of customers. The Android stack is more vulnerable compared to other platforms because of its open-source nature. There are many android malware detection techniques available to exploit the source code and find associated components during execution time. To obtain a better result we create a hybrid technique merging static and dynamic processes. In this paper, in the first part, we have proposed a technique to check for correlation between features and classify using a supervised learning approach to avoid Multicollinearity problem is one of the drawbacks in the existing system. In the proposed work, a novel PCA (Principal Component Analysis) based feature reduction technique is implemented with conditional dependency features by gathering the functionalities of the application which adds novelty for the given approach. The Android Sensitive Permission is one major key point to be considered while detecting malware. We select vulnerable columns based on features like sensitive permissions, application program interface calls, services requested through the kernel, and the relationship between the variables henceforth build the model using machine learning classifiers and identify whether the given application is malicious or benign. The final goal of this paper is to check benchmarking datasets collected from various repositories like virus share, Github, and the Canadian Institute of cyber security, compare with models ensuring zero-day exploits can be monitored and detected with better accuracy rate.

AB  - The SARS-CoV-2 virus, which induces an acute respiratory illness commonly referred to as COVID-19, had been designated as a pandemic by the World Health Organization due to its highly infectious nature and the associated public health risks it poses globally. Identifying the critical factors for predicting mortality is essential for improving patient therapy. Unlike other data types, such as computed tomography scans, x-radiation, and ultrasounds, basic blood test results are widely accessible and can aid in predicting mortality. The present research advocates the utilization of machine learning (ML) methodologies for predicting the likelihood of infectious disease like COVID-19 mortality by leveraging blood test data. Age, LDH (lactate dehydrogenase), lymphocytes, neutrophils, and hs-CRP (high-sensitivity C-reactive protein) are five extremely potent characteristics that, when combined, can accurately predict mortality in 96% of cases. By combining XGBoost feature importance with neural network classification, the optimal approach can predict mortality with exceptional accuracy from infectious disease, along with achieving a precision rate of 90% up to 16 days before the event. The studies suggested model's excellent predictive performance and practicality were confirmed through testing with three instances that depended on the days to the outcome. By carefully analyzing and identifying patterns in these significant biomarkers insightful information has been obtained for simple application. This study offers potential remedies that could accelerate decision-making for targeted medical treatments within healthcare systems, utilizing a timely, accurate, and reliable method.

AB  - The increase in the availability of real-world data (RWD), in combination with advances in machine learning (ML) methods, provides a unique opportunity for the integration of the two to explore complex clinical pharmacology questions. Here we present a recently developed RWD/ML framework that utilizes ML algorithms to understand the influence and importance of various covariates on the use of a given dose and schedule for drugs that have multiple approved dosing regimens. To demonstrate the application of this framework, we present atezolizumab as a use case on account of its three approved alternative intravenous (IV) dosing regimens. As expected, the real-world use of atezolizumab has generally been increasing since 2016 for the 1200 mg every 3 weeks regimen and since 2019 for the 1680 mg every 4 weeks regimen. Out of the ML algorithms evaluated, XGBoost performed the best, as measured by the area under the precision-recall curve, with an emphasis on the under-sampled class given the imbalance in the data. The importance of features was measured by Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) values and showed metastatic breast cancer and use of protein-bound paclitaxel as the most correlated with the use of 840 mg every 2 weeks. Although patient usage data for alternative IV dosing regimens are still maturing, these analyses provide initial insights on the use of atezolizumab and set up a framework for the re-analysis of atezolizumab (at a future data cut) as well as application to other molecules with approved alternative dosing regimens.

AB  - This study compared popular Deep Learning (DL) architectures to classify machining surface roughness using sound and force data. The DL architectures considered in this study include Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), Convolution Neural Network (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and transformer. The classification was performed on the sound and force data generated during machining aluminum sheets for different levels of spindle speed, feed rate, depth of cut, and end-mill diameter, and it was trained on 30 s machining data (10-40 s) of the machining experiments. Since a raw audio waveform is seldom used in DL models, Mel-Spectrogram and Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) audio feature extraction techniques were used in the DL models. The results of DL models were compared for the training-validation accuracy, training epochs, and training parameters of each model. Although the roughness classification by all the DL models was satisfactory (except for CNN with Mel-Spectrogram), the transformer-based modes had the highest training (>96%) and validation accuracies (≈90%). The CNN model with Mel-Spectrogram exhibited the worst training and inference accuracy, which is influenced by limited training data. Confusion matrices were plotted to observe the classification accuracy visually. The confusion matrices showed that the transformer model trained on Mel-Spectrogram and the transformer model trained on MFCCs correctly predicted 366 (or 91.5%) and 371 (or 92.7%) out of 400 test samples. This study also highlights the suitability and superiority of the transformer model for time series sound and force data and over other DL models.

AB  - Photovoltaic systems have reached impressive efficiencies, with records in the range of 20-30% for single-junction cells based on many different materials, yet the fundamental Shockley-Queisser efficiency limit of 34% is still out of reach. Improved photonic design can help approach the efficiency limit by eliminating losses from incomplete absorption or nonradiative recombination. This Perspective reviews nanopatterning methods and metasurfaces for increased light incoupling and light trapping in light absorbers and describes nanophotonics opportunities to reduce carrier recombination and utilize spectral conversion. Beyond the state-of-the-art single junction cells, photonic design plays a crucial role in the next generation of photovoltaics, including tandem and self-adaptive solar cells, and to extend the applicability of solar cells in many different ways. We address the exciting research opportunities and challenges in photonic design principles and fabrication that will accelerate the massive upscaling and (invisible) integration of photovoltaics into every available surface.

To address this problem, we statistically characterize common NGS quality features and develop a novel quality control procedure involving tree-based and deep learning classification algorithms. Predictive models, validated on internal and external functional genomics datasets, are to some extent generalizable to data from unseen species. The derived statistical guidelines and predictive models represent a valuable resource for users of NGS data to better understand quality issues and perform automatic quality control.

geometric size measures indirectly. In this article, a Monte Carlo algorithm for
simultaneous estimation of hyper-volumes and hyper-surface areas of a class of
compact sets in Euclidean space is developed. The algorithm is based on
Santalo’s formula and the Hadwiger formula from integral geometry, and employs a
comparison principle to assign geometric probabilities. An essential component
of the method is to be able to generate uniform sets of random lines on the
sphere. We utilize an empirically established method to generate these random
chords, and we describe a geometric randomness model associated with it. We
verify our results by computing measures for hyper-ellipsoids and certain

        <jats:p>The development of mobile applications is rapidly increasing with the advances in smartphone technology. These applications are intended to assist mobile users in accomplishing various daily tasks including e-commerce and online services. Many mobile applications were also developed to attack smartphone users. Hence, new challenges have been found such as the difficulty to distinguish between benign and malicious malware categories.In this paper, two approaches for classifying malware applications are presented, including Conv1d (Conventional one dimension) and LSTM (Long short Time Memory). The proposed approaches have modeled and solved the malware classification problem using the natural language processing method. Two encoding techniques, binary and text encoding, were conducted on android permissions as a preprocessing phase. In addition, two other classifiers, the Support Vector Machine (SVM) and K-Nearest Neighbor(KNN) were also reported. The two main approaches were evaluated on well-known dataset, the CICMalDroid2020. The Conv1d-approach and LSTM-approach using text encoding achieved the best classification, i.e., high precision and accuracy (98.16\%, 97.72\% and 96.63\%, 96.69\%, respectively). The Conv1d-approach on binary classification has outperformed the LSTM-approach model when compared with Mal-prem and datasets. The Conv1d-approach achieved the best performance, with 99.3\%,99.80\%, 98.90\%, and 98.95\% of accuracy.</jats:p>

AB  - Basalt fiber-reinforced concrete (BFRC) mixed with fly ash, combined with advanced machine learning techniques, offers a practical, cost-effective, and less time-consuming alternative to traditional experimental methods. Conventional approaches to evaluating mechanical properties, such as compressive and splitting tensile strengths, typically require sophisticated equipment, meticulous sample preparation, and extended testing periods. These methods demand substantial financial resources, specialized labor, and considerable time for data collection and analysis. The integration of machine learning provides a transformative solution by enabling accurate prediction of concrete properties with minimal experimental data. The methods of data collection from literature and analysis were used and 121 records were collected from experimentally tested basalt fiber reinforced concrete samples measuring the compressive and splitting tensile strengths of the concrete. Eleven (11) critical factors have been considered as constituents of the studied concrete to predict the Fc-Compressive strength (MPa) and Fsp-Splitting tensile strength (MPa), which are the output parameters. The collected records were divided into training set (96 records = 80%) and validation set (25 records = 20%) following the requirements for data partitioning for sustainable machine learning application. Seven (7) selected machine learning techniques are applied in the prediction. Further, performance evaluation indices were used to compare the models' abilities and lastly, the Hoffman and Gardener's technique was used to evaluate the sensitivity of the parameters on the concrete strengths. At the end of the exercise, results were collated. In predicting the compressive strength (Fc), AdaBoost similarly excels, matching XGBoosting's validation performance with R<sup>2</sup> of 0.98 and the same MAE values. This shows the effectiveness of boosting techniques for predictive modeling in concrete strength estimation. For splitting tensile strength (Fsp), AdaBoost also outperforms most models, achieving an R<sup>2</sup> of 0.96 for training and validation phases. Its exceptionally low validation MAE of 0.124 MPa underscores its excellent generalization capabilities. Overall, XGBoosting and AdaBoost consistently demonstrate superior performance for both compressive and splitting tensile strength predictions, followed closely by KNN. These models benefit from advanced ensemble techniques that efficiently handle non-linear patterns and noise. SVR also performs admirably, whereas GEP and GMDHNN exhibit weaker predictive capabilities due to limitations in handling complex data dynamics. For the sensitivity analysis, the Hoffman and Gardener's method of sensitivity analysis proves instrumental in identifying key drivers of strength in fiber-reinforced concrete, guiding informed decision-making for material optimization and sustainable construction practices.

AB  - Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a fatal blood disorder characterized by the excessive proliferation of immature white blood cells, originating in the bone marrow. An effective prognosis and treatment of ALL calls for its accurate and timely detection. Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown promising results in digital pathology. However, they face challenges in classifying different subtypes of leukemia due to their subtle morphological differences. This study proposes an improved pipeline for binary detection and sub-type classification of ALL from blood smear images. At first, a customized, 88 layers deep CNN is proposed and trained using transfer learning along with GoogleNet CNN to create an ensemble of features. Furthermore, this study models the feature selection problem as a combinatorial optimization problem and proposes a memetic version of binary whale optimization algorithm, incorporating Differential Evolution-based local search method to enhance the exploration and exploitation of feature search space. The proposed approach is validated using publicly available standard datasets containing peripheral blood smear images of various classes of ALL. An overall best average accuracy of 99.15% is achieved for binary classification of ALL with an 85% decrease in the feature vector, together with 99% precision and 98.8% sensitivity. For B-ALL sub-type classification, the best accuracy of 98.69% is attained with 98.7% precision and 99.57% specificity. The proposed methodology shows better performance metrics as compared with several existing studies.

AB  - Over the past decade, genetic engineering has witnessed a revolution with the emergence of a relatively new genetic editing tool based on RNA-guided nucleases: the CRISPR/Cas9 system. Since the first report in 1987 and characterization in 2007 as a bacterial defense mechanism, this system has garnered immense interest and research attention. CRISPR systems provide immunity to bacteria against invading genetic material; however, with specific modifications in sequence and structure, it becomes a precise editing system capable of modifying the genomes of a wide range of organisms. The refinement of these modifications encompasses diverse approaches, including the development of more accurate nucleases, understanding of the cellular context and epigenetic conditions, and the re-designing guide RNAs (gRNAs). Considering the critical importance of the correct performance of CRISPR/Cas9 systems, our scope will emphasize the latter approach. Hence, we present an overview of the past and the most recent guide RNA web-based design tools, highlighting the evolution of their computational architecture and gRNA characteristics over the years. Our study explains computational approaches that use machine learning techniques, neural networks, and gRNA/target interactions data to enable predictions and classifications. This review could open the door to a dynamic community that uses up-to-date algorithms to optimize and create promising gRNAs, suitable for modern CRISPR/Cas9 engineering.

AB  - ABSTRACT Background DNAs released from tumor cells into blood (circulating tumor DNAs, ctDNAs) carry tumor-specific genomic aberrations, providing a non-invasive means for cancer detection. In this study, we aimed to leverage somatic copy number aberration (SCNA) in ctDNA to develop assays to detect early-stage HCCs. Methods We conducted low-depth whole-genome sequencing (WGS) to profile SCNAs in 384 plasma samples of hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related HCC and cancer-free HBV patients, using one discovery and two validation cohorts. To fully capture the robust signals of WGS data from the complete genome, we developed a machine learning-based statistical model that is focused on detection accuracy in early-stage HCC. Findings We built the model using a discovery cohort of 209 patients, achieving an overall area under curve (AUC) of 0.893, with 0.874 for early-stage (Barcelona clinical liver cancer [BCLC] stage 0-A) and 0.933 for advanced-stage (BCLC stage B-D). The performance of the model was then assessed in two validation cohorts (76 and 99 patients) that only consisted of patients with stage 0-A HCC. Our model exhibited a robust predictive performance, with an AUC of 0.920 and 0.812 for the two validation cohorts. Further analyses showed the impact of tumor sample heterogeneity in model training on detecting early-stage tumors, and a refined model addressing the heterogeneity in the discovery cohort significantly increased model performance in validation. Interpretation We developed an SCNA-based, machine learning-driven model in the non-invasive detection of early-stage HCC in HBV patients and demonstrated its performance through strict independent validations.

AB  - In broiler chickens, fractures of wings and legs are recorded at poultry slaughterhouses based on the time of occurrence. Prekilling (PRE) fractures occur before the death of animal, so the chicken was still able to experience pain and distress associated with the injury (an animal welfare issue). Postkilling (POST) fractures occur when the chickens are deceased and fully bled-out and consequently unable to feel pain (not an animal welfare issue). Current practice dictates that fractures are recognized visually and recorded by the animal welfare officers as mandated by European Union and/or national regulations. However, new potential monitoring solutions are desired since human inspection suffers from some significant limitations including subjectivism and fatigue. One possible solution in detecting injuries is X-ray computed tomography (CT) scanning and in this study we aim to evaluate the potential of CT scanning and visual inspection in detecting limb fractures and their causes. Eighty-three chicken wings and 60 chicken legs (n = 143) were collected from a single slaughterhouse and classified by an animal welfare officer as PRE, POST or healthy (HEAL). Samples were photographed and CT scanned at a veterinary hospital. The interpretation of CT scans along with photographs took place in 3 rounds (1. CT scans only, 2. CT scans + photographs, 3. photographs only) and was performed independently by 3 veterinarians. The consistency of the interpretation in 3 rounds was compared with the animal welfare officer's classification. Furthermore, selected samples were also analyzed by histopathological examination due to questionability of their classification (PRE/POST). In questionable samples, presence of hemorrhages was confirmed, thus they fit better as PRE. The highest consistency between raters was obtained in the 2nd round, indicating that interpretation accuracy was the highest when CT scans were combined with photographs. These results indicate that CT scanning in combination with visual inspection can be used in detecting limbs fracture and potentially applied as a tool to monitor animal welfare in poultry slaughterhouses in the future.

AB  - <jats:p>The Internet of Things (IoT) is increasingly affecting human lives in multiple profound ways. “Things” have the ability to communicate, generate, transmit and store data over the network connection. During each communication between “Things”, the data transmitted is potentially vulnerable to malicious attacks, loss, distortions and interruption which impair functionality, system efficiency and user satisfaction. Additionally, inappropriate user controls can cause problems in IoT services, such as granting anonymous users access to personal resources and enable legitimate users to access resources in an illegal manner or preventing legitimate users to access resources in an authorized manner. Therefore, communications between things need to be authenticated, authorized, secured and ensured to have high privacy by applying a strong authentication protocol. The aim of this research is to enhance the authentication protocol, starting by reducing the heavy use of storage in “Things”, and eliminating unnecessary messages during authentication steps, taking into consideration the network security analysis. This research represents a security performance analysis and enhancement authentication for the IoT. The results indicate that the enhanced protocol has a positive effect on minimizing packet length and time performance in authenticating users having once obtained access to the visited location area compared with the other two protocols used for comparative purposes, with 33% increased the proposed protocol performance.</jats:p>

AB  - Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a severe chronic disease that affects human health and has a high prevalence worldwide. Research has shown that half of the diabetic people throughout the world are unaware that they have DM and its complications are increasing, which presents new research challenges and opportunities. In this paper, we propose a preemptive diagnosis method for diabetes mellitus (DM) to assist or complement the early recognition of the disease in countries with low medical expert densities. Diabetes data are collected from the Zewditu Memorial Hospital (ZMHDD) in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM) is one of the most recent successful research findings for the gradient boosting framework that uses tree-based learning algorithms. It has low computational complexity and, therefore, is suited for applications in limited capacity regions such as Ethiopia. Thus, in this study, we apply the principle of LightGBM to develop an accurate model for the diagnosis of diabetes. The experimental results show that the prepared diabetes dataset is informative to predict the condition of diabetes mellitus. With accuracy, AUC, sensitivity, and specificity of 98.1%, 98.1%, 99.9%, and 96.3%, respectively, the LightGBM model outperformed KNN, SVM, NB, Bagging, RF, and XGBoost in the case of the ZMHDD dataset.

AB  - We present a novel reduced order model (ROM) approach for parameterized time-dependent PDEs based on modern learning. The ROM is suitable for multi-query problems and is nonintrusive. It is divided into two distinct stages: a nonlinear dimensionality reduction stage that handles the spatially distributed degrees of freedom based on convolutional autoencoders, and a parameterized time-stepping stage based on memory aware neural networks (NNs), specifically causal convolutional and long short-term memory NNs. Strategies to ensure generalization and stability are discussed. To show the variety of problems the ROM can handle, the methodology is demonstrated on the advection equation, and the flow past a cylinder problem modeled by the incompressible Navier–Stokes equations.

AB  - This paper deals with the prediction of surface roughness in manufacturing polycarbonate (PC) by applying Bayesian optimization for machine learning models. The input variables of ultraprecision turning—namely, feed rate, depth of cut, spindle speed, and vibration of the X-, Y-, and Z-axis—are the main factors affecting surface quality. In this research, six machine learning- (ML-) based models—artificial neural network (ANN), Cat Boost Regression (CAT), Support Vector Machine (SVR), Gradient Boosting Regression (GBR), Decision Tree Regression (DTR), and Extreme Gradient Boosting Regression (XGB)—were applied to predict the surface roughness (Ra). The predictive performance of the baseline models was quantitatively assessed through error metrics: root means square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and coefficient of determination (R2). The overall results indicate that the XGB and CAT models predict Ra with the greatest accuracy. In improving baseline models such as XGB and CAT, the Bayesian optimization (BO) is next used to determine their best hyperparameters, and the results indicate that XGB is the best model according to the evaluation metrics. Results have shown that the performance of the models has been improved significantly with BO. For example, the values of RMSE and MAE of XGB have decreased from 0.0076 to 0.0047 and from 0.0063 to 0.0027, respectively, for the training dataset. Using the testing dataset, the values of RMSE and MAE of XGB have decreased from 0.4033 to 0.2512 and from 0.2845 to 0.2225, respectively. Moreover, the vibrations of the X, Y, and Z axes and feed rate are the most significant feature in predicting the results, which is in high accordance with the literature. We find that, in a specified value domain, the vibration of the axes has a greater influence on the surface quality than does the cutting condition.

AB  - Ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC) services are intrinsically challenging to deliver, with many 5G and future services, including mobile game streaming, adding further complexity by demanding zero service downtime in high-mobility scenarios. Solving these challenges is essential and must be addressed beyond mobile gaming to realise a multitude of current and future services like eX-tended/Virtual Reality(XR/VR) or holoportation in mobile scenarios. Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC) brings services "closer" to user consumption with evident advantages yet at the cost of maintaining a zero downtime guarantee when user handovers (HOs) are prevalent due to the decentralisation of services towards the network edge. In this work, we design and evaluate intelligent HO prediction models between radio 5G Base Stations. The motivation for timely user HO prediction lies in being a vital presupposition for path steering and other MANO control actions in contemporary programmable 5G networks to deliver a zero downtime perception during HO events. Our detailed simulation and actual testbed evaluation results show that effective HO prediction can be achieved using a combination of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) or gradient boost regression with classification models, with the latter filtering out any Reference Signal Received Power (RSRP) prediction input outliers for predicting the serving cell.

AB  - Bacterial biofilms are a source of infectious human diseases and are heavily linked to antibiotic resistance. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a multidrug-resistant bacterium widely present and implicated in several hospital-acquired infections. Over the last years, the development of new drugs able to inhibit Pseudomonas aeruginosa by interfering with its ability to form biofilms has become a promising strategy in drug discovery. Identifying molecules able to interfere with biofilm formation is difficult, but further developing these molecules by rationally improving their activity is particularly challenging, as it requires knowledge of the specific protein target that is inhibited. This work describes the development of a machine learning multitechnique consensus workflow to predict the protein targets of molecules with confirmed inhibitory activity against biofilm formation by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. It uses a specialized database containing all the known targets implicated in biofilm formation by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The experimentally confirmed inhibitors available on ChEMBL, together with chemical descriptors, were used as the input features for a combination of nine different classification models, yielding a consensus method to predict the most likely target of a ligand. The implemented algorithm is freely available at https://github.com/BioSIM-Research-Group/TargIDe under licence GNU General Public Licence (GPL) version 3 and can easily be improved as more data become available.

AB  - The emergence of a new generation of alloys, namely high-entropy alloys, has revealed the significance of the entropy effect in alloy design. Inspired by this concept, lightweight Al-based entropy alloys have been proposed recently. With increasing demand for low-density structural materials, these new alloys have significant potential for diverse applications. This review provides an overview of lightweight Al-based entropy alloys, covering their developmental background, design principles, fabrication methods, microstructures, and mechanical properties, as well as alloys suitable for high-temperature applications. A comprehensive investigation of current research on Al-based entropy alloys with a density lower than 4.0 g cm −3 was conducted from 122 different alloys. Lightweight Al-based entropy alloys could bridge the gap between conventional Al and Ti alloys in terms of mechanical properties and density. The excellent thermal stabilities of these alloys make them attractive structural materials for use at elevated temperatures. In addition, machine learning has been suggested as an effective computational tool for alloy development. Finally, future trends in the field of lightweight Al-based entropy alloys are discussed.

AB  - Abstract Cross-domain information is essential for building energy performance assessment. The heterogeneous nature of this information is a major source for inefficient assessments. The semantic web provides a flexible pathway for addressing recognised interoperability issues. However, further implicit knowledge in cross-domain information could provide meaningful solutions for such assessments. This paper aims to develop a conceptual framework that links cross-domain information, infers implicit knowledge, and empowers building managers with insightful assessments. The framework integrates Web Ontology Language (OWL) ontologies, Resource Description Framework (RDF) instances, and a set of predefined rules to infer implicit knowledge, which can satisfy data requirements of performance metrics and enable meaningful performance assessments. Then building managers can identify inefficient building operations and improve energy efficiency while maintaining desired building functions. This approach reduces burdensome intervention from the managers when compared with traditional solutions. A demonstration highlights the engineering value by evaluating energy performance of a university building.

AB  - Relevance of NF-kB and NRF2 transcription factors into multiple myeloma pathophysiology – A preliminary study Raquel Alves1,2,3, Ana Cristina Gonçalves1,2,3, Joana Jorge1,2,3, Catarina Afonso4, Adriana Roque4, Artur Paiva2,5, Letícia Ribeiro 2,4, Catarina Geraldes1,2,4, Ana Bela Sarmento-Ribeiro1,2,3,4 1Laboratory of Oncobiology and Hematology and University Clinic of Hematologly, Faculty of Medicine of University of Coimbra, Portugal;2iCBR-Coimbra Institute for Clinical and Biomedical Research – Area of Environment, Genetics and Oncobiology (CIMAGO), Faculty of Medicine, University of Coimbra and CIBB - Center for Innovative Biomedicine and Biotechnology, University of Coimbra, Portugal;3CACC-Clinical Academic Center of Coimbra, Portugal;4Clinical Hematology Department, Centro Hospitalar e Universitário de Coimbra, Portugal;5Flow Cytometry Operational Management Unit, Clinical Pathology Service, Centro Hospitalar e Universitário de Coimbra, Portugal. Multiple myeloma (MM) is a mature B cell dyscrasia characterized by an abnormal proliferation of monoclonal plasma cells, the presence of CRAB symptoms and/or myeloma-defining events. Bone marrow's microenvironment and nuclear factor-κB (NF-kB) signaling pathway play a relevant role in MM pathogenesis, constituting now therapeutic targets. Furthermore, oxidative stress has been observed in several hematopoietic malignancies, being the NF-kB and the nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (NRF2) the two key transcription factors (TFs) that regulate the cellular responses to oxidative stress and inflammation. This work aims to elucidate the importance of NF-kB and NRF2 axis in the MM biology and response to treatment. Thirty patients with MM were enrolled in the study and the bone marrow cell populations were evaluated by flow cytometry. The expression levels of NF-KB and its phosphorylated form, and of NRF2 were determined in the different cell populations, with a special focus on plasm cells, using flow cytometry. The TFs expression levels were correlated with clinical and laboratorial data. Our cohort of 30 MM patients included 12 females and 18 males, with a median age at diagnosis of 62 years (32–74). Two patients at diagnosis, fourteen patients in remission and fourteen in relapse. According with international scoring system (ISS) 12 patients (40%) were in stage I, 10 patients (33.3%) in stage II, 5 patients (16.7%) in stage III and the ISS was not determined in 3 patients (10%). In tumor plasma cells, we observed at diagnosis a higher percentage of cells expressing NRF2 (22.9 ± 22.7) and NF-kB (21.7 ± 21.5) comparing with observed at remission time-point (NRF2: 7.0 ± 3.1; NF-kB: 4.3 ± 1.5). An intermediated expression was observed (NRF2: 12.2 ± 4.3; NF-kB: 6.5 ± 1.8) in samples at relapse. The increase of tumor plasma cells expressing these TFs was also associated with the presence of bone lesion and kappa light-chains. All the other bone marrow populations expressed these TFs, but higher expression was observed in granulocytes. Our preliminary data suggest an association of NRF-2 and NF-kB expression with MM pathophysiology and disease stage. This work was supported by CIMAGO and NRC-LPCC/CIMAGO grant. STAT5 – A new therapeutic target in acute lymphoblastic leukemia? Joana Jorge1,2,3, Alexandre Estevam1, Raquel Alves1,2,3, Beatriz Lapa1,2,3, José Manuel Nascimento-Costa2,3,4, Ana Cristina Gonçalves1,2,3, Ana Bela Sarmento-Ribeiro1,2,3,5 1Laboratory of Oncobiology and Hematology and University Clinic of Hematology, Faculty of Medicine of University of Coimbra (FMUC), Coimbra, Portugal;2iCBR-Coimbra Institute for Clinical and Biomedical Research – Area of Environment, Genetics and Oncobiology (CIMAGO), Faculty of Medicine, University of Coimbra, CIBB - Center for Innovative Biomedicine and Biotechnology, University of Coimbra, Portugal;3CACC-Clinical Academic Center of Coimbra, Portugal;4University Clinic of Oncology/Faculty of Medicine of University of Coimbra (FMUC), Coimbra, Portugal;5Clinical Hematology Department/Centro Hospital e Universitário de Coimbra, Coimbra, Portugal The signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) family members regulate the transcription of multiple genes involved in cell survival, proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. Deregulation of STATs was associated with several hematological neoplasias such as acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). ALL is a malignant transformation and proliferation of lymphoid progenitor cells in the bone marrow, blood and extramedullary sites. Several genetic and epigenetic alterations are involved in ALL pathogenesis that induce a cellular homeostasis unbalance resulting in differentiation arrest, high proliferation rates and/or resistance to apoptosis. Pimozide (PIM) is a STAT5 inhibitor that presented an anti-neoplastic effect in several other tumors. With this study, we assessed the therapeutic potential of PIM in in vitro models of ALL. To this end, two B-ALL cell lines (697 and REH) and two T-ALL (CEM and Jurkat) were incubated with PIM in single and daily administration schemes. Metabolic activity was evaluated by resazurin assay. Cell death was assessed by optic microscopy (May-Grünwald-Giemsa staining) and flow cytometry (FC), using the Annexin V and 7-AAD double staining. Cell cycle was evaluated by FC (IP/RNase). The expression levels of JAK/STAT target genes (CCNB1, CCNE1, CCND1, BCL2, KI-67, e HPRT1) were measured by qPCR. The statistical analysis was performed, considering a significance level of 95%. Our results showed that PIM reduced the metabolic activity in a time, dose and cell line dependent manner. T-ALL cell lines were more sensitive to PIM, with an IC50, at 72 h, of 7.5 μM (both CEM and Jurkat) comparing to the observed in B-ALL cells (10 μM for both, 697 and REH). Daily administration of 2.5 μM PIM demonstrated to be more effective than single administration of 7.5 μM. PIM induced cell death mainly by apoptosis, as observed by FC and by morphological analysis, and also cell cycle arrest in G0/G1 phase in all cell lines. Incubation with PIM also reduced the expression of JAK/STAT targeted genes. Our results suggest that PIM presents a therapeutic potential in in vitro ALL models and might be explored in other pre-clinical models. This work was supported by FMUC, CIMAGO and FCT (SFRH/BD/51994/2012). Aldehyde dehydrogenase polymorphisms: The role in myelodysplastic syndromes and acute myeloid leukemia Duarte Silva1, Ana Cristina Gonçalves1,2,3, Bárbara Marques1,4, Joana Jorge1,2,3, Raquel Alves1,2,3, André Barbosa Ribeiro2,4,Emília Cortesão1,2,3,4, José M. Nascimento Costa2,3,5, Ana Bela Sarmento-Ribeiro1,2,3,4 1Laboratory of Oncobiology and Hematology and University Clinic of Hematology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Coimbra,Portugal;2iCBR-Coimbra Institute for Clinical and Biomedical Research – Area of Environment, Genetics and Oncobiology (CIMAGO), Faculty of Medicine, University of Coimbra and CIBB - Center for Innovative Biomedicine and Biotechnology, University of Coimbra, Portugal;3CACC-Clinical Academic Center of Coimbra, Portugal;4Clinical Hematology Department/Centro Hospitalar e Universitário de Coimbra, Coimbra, Portugal;5University Clinic of Oncology/Faculty of Medicine, University of Coimbra, Coimbra, Portugal Aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) is highly expressed in hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) and inhibition of ALDH promotes HSC self-renewal via reduction of retinoic acid activity. Since myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) pathogenesis is associated with genetic and epigenetic changes in HSC, dysregulation of processes related with differentiation and cellular proliferation of these stem cells may be associated with the development of these hematological neoplasias. Thus, this study aims to analyze the role of ALDH1A2, ALDH3A1, and ALDH16A1 genetic variability in MDS and AML development and progression, in order to identify new potential risk factors and/or prognostic markers. ALDH single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) (ALDH1A2: rs4646626, ALDH3A1: rs2228100, ALDH3A1: rs887241 and ALDH16A1: rs1320303) were genotyped using tetra-primer-ARMS-PCR, in 99 MN patients (49 MDS patients and 50 AML patients), and in 118 control individuals. The role of SNPs in MDS and AML susceptibility and development/progression was assessed by logistic regression analysis. The overall survival was analyzed by Kaplan-Meier method. Our results show that ALDH3A1 (rs2228100) CG genotype was associated with MN and MDS development (MN: OR=2.072, 95%CI 1.197–3.585, p = 0.009; MDS: OR = 2.204, 95%CI 1.119–4.344, p = 0.022), while GG carriers have 3.4x lower risk of MN development (OR = 0.296, 95%CI 0.105–0.828, p = 0.02). Additionally, ALDH3A1 CG and GT haplotypes were associated with MDS risk (CG: OR = 1.901, 95%CI 1.181–3.062, p = 0.0104; GT: OR = 2.855, 95%CI 1.253–6.504, p = 0.0200), while CT haplotype carriers have 2.25x lower risk of MDS development (OR = 0.444, 95%CI 0.243–0.812, p = 0.0092). ALDH1A2 (rs4646626) GG genotype were associated with higher risk of MDS progression. In AML group, the ALDH1A2 (rs4646626) heterozygous carriers (AG) showed higher overall survival than homozygous carriers (AA + GG) (HR = 0.513, 95%CI 0.273–0.966, p = 0.035). Altogether, these findings reinforce the association of ALDH with MN susceptibility. The participation of ALDHs in oxidative stress and mutagenesis, contribute to the role of these enzymes in MN development, progression and prognosis. IREB2 rs17483548 single nucleotide polymorphism is associated with colorectal cancer Rui Gomes1, Ana Cristina Gonçalves1,2,3, Joana Jorge1,2,3, Raquel Alves1,2,3, Amélia Pereira1,4, Ana Bela Sarmento-Ribeiro1,2,3,5, José M. Nascimento Costa2,3,6 1Laboratory of Oncobiology and Hematology and University Clinic of Hematology/Faculty of Medicine, University of Coimbra, Portugal;2iCBR-Coimbra Institute for Clinical and Biomedical Research – Area of Environment, Genetics and Oncobiology (CIMAGO), Faculty of Medicine, University of Coimbra and CIBB - Center for Innovative Biomedicine and Biotechnology, University of Coimbra, Portugal;3CACC-Clinical Academic Center of Coimbra, Portugal;4Medicine Department, Hospital Distrital da Figueira da Foz, EPE, Figueira da Foz, Portugal;5Clinical Hematology Department/Centro Hospitalar e Universitário de Coimbra, Coimbra, Portugal;6University Clinic of Oncology/Faculty of Medicine, University of Coimbra, Coimbra, Portugal Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common cancer worldwide. The CRC risk is determined by a complex interaction between environmental exposures and genetic variants. A growing body of evidence has proved that iron overload and dietary iron are associated with CRC. Considering the fundamental role of iron-regulatory protein 2 (IRP2) in the regulation of intracellular iron homeostasis, it is reasonable that some polymorphisms in IREB2 gene, which encode IRP2, could be involved in CRC carcinogenesis. In this context, we investigated the role of IREB2 rs17483548 single nucleotide polymorphism in CRC susceptibility, location, staging, and prognosis, in order to identify new potential risk factors and/or prognostic markers. To this end, a hospital-based case-control study with 83 CRC patients and 176 healthy controls was conducted. DNA from patients and controls was extracted from whole blood samples and the IREB2 rs17483548 corresponding genomic region was amplified by tetra-primer ARMS-PCR assay. The role of this variant in CRC susceptibility was performed by logistic regression analysis. The overall survival of patients stratified according to their genotypes was analyzed by Kaplan-Meier method (log-rank test and Cox proportional hazards model). The results showed that GA genotype (OR = 0.522, 95% CI 0.287–0.951, p = 0.034) and AA genotype (OR = 0.361, 95% CI 0.167–0.782, p = 0.010) were associated with a decreased susceptibility for CRC. On the other hand, GG genotype (OR = 2.133, 95% CI 1.212–3.755, p = 0.009) was found to increase the risk of CRC development. Additionally, GA and AA genotypes were associated with an increased predisposition for locoregional CRC. In contrast, GG genotype decreases the risk of right and transverse colon neoplasms. However, CRC patient's overall survival was not influenced by this genetic variant (HR = 1.269; 95% CI 0.615–2.620; p = 0.519). Altogether, these results suggest that IREB2 (rs17483548) single nucleotide polymorphism is associated with CRC development and may play an important role in tumor susceptibility and staging. However, more studies are needed to better characterize the impact of this single nucleotide polymorphism in CRC. NRF2 modulation as a new therapeutic approach in AML – In vitro studies Diana Figueiredo1, Joana Jorge1,2,3, Raquel Alves1,2,3, Beatriz Lapa1,2,3, Ana Cristina Gonçalves1,2,3, Ana Bela Sarmento-Ribeiro1,2,3,4 1Laboratory of Oncobiology and Hematology and University Clinic of Hematology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Coimbra, Portugal;2iCBR-Coimbra Institute for Clinical and Biomedical Research – Area of Environment, Genetics and Oncobiology (CIMAGO), Faculty of Medicine, University of Coimbra and CIBB - Center for Innovative Biomedicine and Biotechnology, University of Coimbra, Portugal;3CACC-Clinical Academic Center of Coimbra, Portugal;4Clinical Hematology Department, Centro Hospitalar e Universitário de Coimbra, Portugal Oxidative stress (OS), characterized by an imbalance between the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the biological system's ability to neutralize them, has been observed in most cancers, including acute myeloblastic leukemias (AML). An important mechanism in cellular defense against OS is the NRF2 pathway. This transcription factor protects normal cells from malignant transformation, regulating the expression of several antioxidant and detoxification genes. However, once malignant transformation occurs, NRF2 protects tumor cells from OS and preventing chemotherapy-induced cytotoxicity. Understanding the dual role of NRF2 is essential to consider it as a potential therapeutic target in AML. The aim of the present study was to analyze the effect of NRF2 activation and inhibition on AML cell lines. To achieve these goals, two AML cell lines (HEL and THP-1) were culture in absence and presence of ML385 (NRF2 inhibitor) and Oltipraz (NRF2 activator). The metabolic activity was evaluated by resazurin assay and cell death by optical microscopy (May-Grunwald staining) and flow cytometry (FC; Annexin V/7-AAD double staining). Cell cycle analysis was evaluated by FC, using a PI/RNAse solution. The intracellular levels of ROS and GSH were quantified by FC (DCFH2-DA, DHE and MO probes). The expression of NRF2-regulated genes (NFE2L2, KEAP1, NQO1, NFKB1) was tested by qPCR. The results were statistically analyzed considering a level of significance of 95% (p < 0.05). The results showed that both Oltipraz and ML385 decreased the metabolic activity of all cells, with ML385 showing a higher effect compared to Oltipraz (ML385 IC50 72 h: HEL = 30 μM, THP-1 = 65 μM; Oltipraz IC50 not reached). Both drugs induced a cytotoxic effect mediated by apoptosis. In THP-1 cells, a G0/G1 arrest were also observed. Additionally, cells incubated with both drugs showed an increase in the ROS/GSH ratio and in KEAP1 and NQO1 expression levels suggesting that Oltipraz may not be a NRF2 activator, at least in AML cells. The results suggest that AML cells are sensitive to NRF2 modulation and Oltipraz and ML385 may represent new potential therapeutic approaches in these hematological neoplasms. Epigenetics in chronic lymphocytic leukemia - Role in pathogenesis and treatment José Pedro Carda1,2,3,4, Raquel Alves1,2,3, Joana Jorge1,2,3, Sara Duarte4,Amélia Pereira2,5, Ilda P.

In recent years, more interest has been focused on the contribution of epigenetic changes to CLL development. In this context, the main goal of this work was to clarify the involvement of epigenetic modifications in CLL development, and correlate them with patients' clinical features, survival and prognostic risk groups as well as to analyze the therapeutic potential of epigenetic modulators. The methylation status of 25 tumor suppressor genes (ME001B, MRC-Holland) was carried out in 24 CLL patients with a median age of 70 years (range 50–81), 25% (n = 6) females and 75% (n = 18) males. Regarding Binet staging system, 19 (79%) were low risk (A and B) and five (21%) were high risk (C). Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) obtained from CLL patients were incubated in the absence and presence of decitabine (DAC), azacitidine (5-AC), vorinostat (SAHA) and/or panobinostat (PAN) in several concentrations, during 72 h. Cell viability will be evaluated by fluorometric microculture cytotoxicity assay (FMCA) every 24 h. Cell death were analyzed by flow cytometry (annexin V/7-AAD double stain). The results show that CLL patients have methylation in 13 of the 25 tumor suppressor genes studied, whereas controls only show methylation in the MSH6 gene [6/13 (46%)]. CLL patients have eight of these genes significantly hypermethylated [PAX5: 9/24 (38%); KLLN: 12/24 (50%); WT1: 22/24 (92%); CADM1: 9/24 (38%); THBS1: 13/24 (54%); CDH13: 15/24 (54%); TP53: 9/24 (38%); GATA5: 16/24 (67%)]. In addition, 58% (14/24) of CLL patients have 5 or more methylated genes and high-risk patients have a higher number of methylated genes (11/25) than low-risk patients (8/25). Epigenetic modulation revealed promising results in monotherapy. All drugs reduced the viability of CLL PBMCs (IC50: 30–40 μM 5-AC, 40–50 μM DAC, 50 nM PAN, 2.5–5 μM SAHA), inducing cell death by apoptosis with high specificity for neoplastic B cells. PAN and SAHA also induced a cytostatic effect. This study suggests that DNA methylation is a common event in CLL patients and that epigenetic modulators induce neoplastic B cells death. Therapeutic effect of Oltipraz in acute lymphoblastic leukemia – Preliminary in vitro studies Nisa Magalhães1,2, Diogo Roque1,2,; Maria Inês Costa2, Eduardo Gomes2, Joana Jorge2,3,4, Raquel Alves2,3,4, Beatriz Lapa2,3,4, Ana Cristina Gonçalves2,3,4, Ana Bela Sarmento-Ribeiro2,3,4,5 1Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Science and Technology, University of Coimbra;2Laboratory of Oncobiology and Hematology and University Clinic of Hematology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Coimbra, Portugal;3CACC-Clinical Academic Center of Coimbra, Portugal;4 iCBR-Coimbra Institute for Clinical and Biomedical Research – Area of Environment, Genetics and Oncobiology (CIMAGO), Faculty of Medicine, University of Coimbra and CIBB - Center for Innovative Biomedicine and Biotechnology, University of Coimbra, Portugal;5Clinical Hematology Department, Centro Hospitalar e Universitário de Coimbra, Portugal Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most common hematological neoplasia in childhood, characterized by excessive proliferation of immature lymphoid cells and differentiation arrest, resulting in the accumulation of lymphoblasts and, consequently, the in suppression of normal hematopoiesis. In ALL there is an increase of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and a decrease in antioxidant defenses, which makes evident the involvement of oxidative stress in the disease. The KEAP1-NRF2 pathway is an important mediator of the cytoprotective response to exogenous and endogenous stress induced by ROS. One of the major signaling proteins within this pathway is the transcription factor NRF2, which plays a vital role in cellular defense against oxidative stress through activation of various antioxidant genes. Thus, the aim of this study is to investigate the therapeutic potential of Oltipraz, an activator of NRF2, in T- and B-ALL cell lines. In this context, T-ALL (MOLT-4 and CEM) and B-ALL cell lines (697 and KOPN8) were cultured in the absence and presence of increasing concentrations of Oltipraz in monotherapy for 72 h. Metabolic activity was determined by the resazurin assay. Cell death was assessed with flow cytometry by double labeling with Annexin V and 7-AAD and through morphological analysis by Giemsa staining. Cell cycle was evaluated by flow cytometry using PI/RNase solution. The results were statistically analyzed considering a significance level of 95% (p < 0.05). Preliminary results showed that Oltipraz reduced metabolic activity in a time-, dose- and cell line dependent manner. After 72 h of treatment, B-ALL cells were more sensitive to Oltipraz (697: IC50 = 27.5 μM, KOPN8: IC50 = 4.5 μM) compared to T-ALL cells (MOLT-4: IC50 = 87.3 μM, CEM: IC50 = 40.1 μM). Oltipraz induced cell death by apoptosis in both B- and T-ALL subtypes (697 and MOLT-4). In summary, these preliminary results suggest that Oltipraz has an antiproliferative effect and that ALL-B cells are more sensitive to this drug. In addition, Oltipraz induces some cell death by apoptosis in LLA-T (MOLT-4) and LLA-B (697) cells. Zinc as a genoprotective player of DNA damage response – Preliminary results Maria Inês Costa1, Nisa Magalhães1,2; Diogo Roque1,2; Eduardo Gomes1, Raquel Alves1,3,4, Joana Jorge1,3,4, Beatriz Lapa1,3,4, Mafalda Laranjo3,4,5, Maria Filomena Botelho3,4,6, Ana Bela Sarmento-Ribeiro1,3,4,5, Ana Cristina Gonçalves1,3,4 1Laboratory of Oncobiology and Hematology and University Clinic of Hematology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Coimbra, Portugal;2Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Science and Technology, University of Coimbra;3 iCBR-Coimbra Institute for Clinical and Biomedical Research – Area of Environment, Genetics and Oncobiology (CIMAGO), Faculty of Medicine, University of Coimbra and CIBB - Center for Innovative Biomedicine and Biotechnology, University of Coimbra, Portugal;4CACC-Clinical Academic Center of Coimbra, Portugal;5Clinical Hematology Department, Centro Hospitalar e Universitário de Coimbra, Portugal;6Biophysics Institute/Faculty of Medicine, University of Coimbra, Portugal Micronutrients are important regulators of genomic stability, intervening in relevant pathways of the DNA damage response (DDR) as substrates and cofactors of numerous enzymes. Micronutrients' deficiency was already shown to cause similar effects as those produced by well-known genotoxic agents. Therefore, the adequate provision of micronutrients may be determinant for efficient DNA repair. Zinc is a vital micronutrient and a component of more than 300 enzymes involved in DDR. Increasing evidence has pointed its importance in DNA integrity and repair. The main aim of this study was to investigate the effects of zinc supplementation in cellular ability to handle genotoxic stimuli and DNA repair. The experiments were conducted on one human acute myeloid leukemia cell line (HEL) and on normal human lymphocytes (IMC), incubated for 2 days in RPMI-1640 medium with FBS (non-supplemented standard medium), zinc-depleted FBS and FBS plus 40 μM ZnSO4. Cells were then exposed to 10 μM H2O2 for 30 minutes. Chromosomal damage was analyzed using the cytokinesis-block micronucleus cytome assay. Two hours after H2O2 treatment, DNA repair was accessed with the alkaline comet assay. Our preliminary data shown that zinc supplementation resulted in a lower frequency of micronuclei and other chromosomal abnormalities in HEL and IMC (10 ± 1% and 7.8 ± 0.8%, respectively) when compared to non-supplemented conditions (14 ± 0% and 11.8 ± 0.3%). Zinc-depleted cells presented the highest frequency of chromosomal damage (20 ± 1% and 16.3 ± 3%), suggesting that zinc deficiency might affect cellular ability to cope with genotoxic stimuli. Nuclear buds were the most frequently found lesions in non-supplemented and zinc supplemented cells, whereas zinc depletion resulted mainly in micronuclei. Regarding the analysis of DNA repair, an initial comet assay on IMC shown a reduced DNA repair ability in cells cultured in zinc depletion and a slight recovery in cells from non-supplemented and supplemented mediums. These preliminary results suggest a protective role for zinc on chromosomal damage and a defective DDR when zinc is absent. EPO-EPOR axis as a prognostic and drug response biomarker in myelodysplastic syndrome – Preliminary results Beatriz Lapa1,2, Raquel S. Alves1,2,3, Joana Jorge1,2,3, Emília Cortesão1,2,3,4, Amélia Pereira2,5, Letícia Ribeiro2,3,4, Ana Cristina Gonçalves1,2,3, Ana B.

Anemia is the more frequent cytopenia that could be treated erythropoietin (EPO) stimulating agents (ESA). EPO is the primary regulator of erythropoiesis and has pleiotropic effects. EPO analogs induce erythroid responses in few low-risk MDS patients and some develop neutralizing anti-EPO or anti-EPO receptor (EPOR) antibodies. The aim of this work was to asses EPO and EPOR expression in MDS patients in order to identify novel prognostic and drug response biomarkers. Six peripheral blood samples were collected from MDS patients, and stratified according to recombinant EPO treatment response, patients that respond to EPO treatment (n = 2) and patients that do not respond (n = 4). Flow cytometry was used to identify HSC and progenitor cells and assess the expression of EPO and EPOR. RNA from the samples was isolated and used to evaluate the expression levels of EPO and EPOR by qPCR. The non-responder patients presented a lower percentage of CD34+/CD117+ cells expressing EPOR (4.3 ± 1.4) as well as lower expression levels of EPOR (1810 ± 537) when compared do EPO responders (13.4 ± 1.8 and 4957 ± 414, respectively). The more differentiated progenitor cells (CD34+/CD45dim/CD117+/HLA-/CD13+/CD123+/CD105-) from non-responder patients presented a higher percentage of cells expressing EPOR (23.7 ± 4.8%) compared to responders (2.3 ± 0.5%) and expression levels like EPO responders (responders: 708 ± 65 MIF; non-responders: 772 ± 81 MIF). Furthermore, the responder patients presented an EPO gene expression 4-fold higher (0.50 ± 0.08) than the non-responders (0.13 ± 0.02) but EPOR gene expression presented a similar value (responders: 3.9 ± 0.3; non-responders: 4.3 ± 1.1). EPO responders and non-responders' MDS patients appeared to have different percentage of cells that express EPOR as well as different expression levels of EPO. Therefore, these preliminary results suggest that EPO/EPOR axis could be used as a predictive biomarker of therapy response.

AB  - 5G cellular networks come with many new features compared to the legacy cellular networks, such as network data analytics function (NWDAF), which enables the network operators to either implement their own machine learning (ML) based data analytics methodologies or integrate third-party solutions to their networks. In this paper, the structure and the protocols of NWDAF that are defined in the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) standard documents are first described. Then, cell-based synthetic data set for 5G networks based on the fields defined by the 3GPP specifications is generated. Further, some anomalies are added to this data set (e.g., suddenly increasing traffic in a particular cell), and then these anomalies within each cell, subscriber category, and user equipment are classified. Afterward, three ML models, namely, linear regression, long-short term memory, and recursive neural networks are implemented to study behaviour information estimation (e.g., anomalies in the network traffic) and network load prediction capabilities of NWDAF. For the prediction of network load, three different models are used to minimize the mean absolute error, which is calculated by subtracting the actual generated data from the model prediction value. For the classification of anomalies, two ML models are used to increase the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve, namely, logistic regression and extreme gradient boosting. According to the simulation results, neural network algorithms outperform linear regression in network load prediction, whereas the tree-based gradient boosting algorithm outperforms logistic regression in anomaly detection. These estimations are expected to increase the performance of the 5G network through NWDAF.

AB  - Satellite imagery has long been an attractive data source providing a wealth of information regarding human-inhabited areas. While high-resolution satellite images are rapidly becoming available, limited studies have focused on how to extract meaningful information regarding human habitation patterns and economic scales from such data. We present READ, a new approach for obtaining essential spatial representation for any given district from high-resolution satellite imagery based on deep neural networks. Our method combines transfer learning and embedded statistics to efficiently learn the critical spatial characteristics of arbitrary size areas and represent such characteristics in a fixed-length vector with minimal information loss. Even with a small set of labels, READ can distinguish subtle differences between rural and urban areas and infer the degree of urbanization. An extensive evaluation demonstrates that the model outperforms state-of-the-art models in predicting economic scales, such as the population density in South Korea (R2=0.9617), and shows a high use potential in developing countries where district-level economic scales are unknown.

AB  - Constructing multistate model Hamiltonians from all-atom electronic structure calculations and molecular dynamics simulations is crucial for understanding charge and energy transfer dynamics in complex condensed phases. The most popular two-level system model is the spin-boson Hamiltonian, where the nuclear degrees of freedom are represented as shifted normal modes. Recently, we proposed the general multistate nontrivial extension of the spin-boson model, i.e., the multistate harmonic (MSH) model, which is constructed by extending the spatial dimensions of each nuclear mode so as to satisfy the all-atom reorganization energy restrictions for all pairs of electronic states. In this work, we propose the multistate reaction coordinate (MRC) model with a primary reaction coordinate and secondary bath modes as in the Caldeira-Leggett form but in extended spatial dimensions. The MRC model is proven to be equivalent to the MSH model and offers an intuitive physical picture of the nuclear-electronic feedback in nonadiabatic processes such as the inherent trajectory of the reaction coordinate. The reaction coordinate is represented in extended dimensions, carrying the entire reorganization energies and bilinearly coupled to the secondary bath modes. We demonstrate the MRC model construction for photoinduced charge transfer in an organic photovoltaic caroteniod-porphyrin-C<sub>60</sub> molecular triad dissolved in tetrahydrofuran as well as excitation energy transfer in a photosynthetic light-harvesting Fenna-Matthews-Olson complex. The MRC model provides an effective and robust platform for investigating quantum dissipative dynamics in complex condensed-phase systems since it allows a consistent description of realistic spectral density, state-dependent system-bath couplings, and heterogeneous environments due to static disorder in reorganization energies.

AB  - Cells respond to environmental and developmental stimuli by remodeling their transcriptomes through regulation of both mRNA transcription and mRNA decay. A central goal of biology is identifying the global set of regulatory relationships between factors that control mRNA production and degradation and their target transcripts and construct a predictive model of gene expression. Regulatory relationships are typically identified using transcriptome measurements and causal inference algorithms. RNA kinetic parameters are determined experimentally by employing run-on or metabolic labeling (e.g. 4-thiouracil) methods that allow transcription and decay rates to be separately measured. Here, we develop a deep learning model, trained with single-cell RNA-seq data, that both infers causal regulatory relationships and estimates RNA kinetic parameters. The resulting <i>in silico</i> model predicts future gene expression states and can be perturbed to simulate the effect of transcription factor changes. We acquired model training data by sequencing the transcriptomes of 175,000 individual <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> cells that were subject to an external perturbation and continuously sampled over a one hour period. The rate of change for each transcript was calculated on a per-cell basis to estimate RNA velocity. We then trained a deep learning model with transcriptome and RNA velocity data to calculate time-dependent estimates of mRNA production and decay rates. By separating RNA velocity into transcription and decay rates, we show that rapamycin treatment causes existing ribosomal protein transcripts to be rapidly destabilized, while production of new transcripts gradually slows over the course of an hour. The neural network framework we present is designed to explicitly model causal regulatory relationships between transcription factors and their genes, and shows superior performance to existing models on the basis of recovery of known regulatory relationships. We validated the predictive power of the model by perturbing transcription factors <i>in silico</i> and comparing transcriptome-wide effects with experimental data. Our study represents the first step in constructing a complete, predictive, biophysical model of gene expression regulation.

AB  - Hybrid simulation (HS) is an advanced simulation method that couples experimental testing and analytical modeling to better understand structural systems and individual components’ behavior under extreme events such as earthquakes. Conducting HS and real-time HS (RTHS) can be challenging with complex analytical substructures due to the nature of direct integration algorithms when the finite element method is employed. Thus, alternative methods such as machine learning (ML) models could help tackle these difficulties. This study aims to investigate the quality of the RTHS tests when a deep learning algorithm is used as a metamodel to represent the dynamic behavior of a nonlinear analytical substructure. The compact HS laboratory at the University of Nevada, Reno was utilized to conduct exclusive RTHS tests. Simulating a braced frame structure, the RTHS tests combined, for the first time, linear brace model specimens (physical substructure) along with nonlinear ML models for the frame (analytical substructure). Deep long short-term memory (Deep-LSTM) networks were employed and trained to develop the metamodels of the analytical substructure using the Python environment. The training dataset was obtained from pure analytical finite element simulations for the complete structure under earthquake excitation. The RTHS evaluations were first conducted for virtual RTHS tests, where substructuring was sought between the LSTM metamodel and virtual experimental substructure. To validate the proposed RTHS testing methodology and full system, several actual RTHS tests were conducted. The results from ML-based RTHS were evaluated for different ML models and compared against results from conventional RTHS with finite element models. The paper demonstrates the potential of conducting successful experimental RTHS using Deep-LSTM models, which could open the door for unparalleled new opportunities in structural systems design and assessment.

AB  - Bioinformation is information generated from biological movement. By using a variety of modern technologies, we can use this information to form a meaningful model for researchers to study. An electromyographic (EMG) signal is one type of bioinformation that is used in many areas to help people study human muscle movement. This information can help in both clinical areas and industrial areas. EMG is a very complicated signal, so processing it is vital. The processing of EMG signals is divided into collection, denoising, decomposition, feature extraction and classification steps. In this article, the wavelet denoising step and several decomposition processes are discussed to show the usage of this technique in the final classification step. At the end of the study, we find that after the wavelet denoising step, the classification accuracy, which uses the K-nearest neighbor of the independent component analysis features, improves, but the accuracy of the wavelet coefficient features and autoregression coefficient features decreases.

AB  - The strain on healthcare resources brought forth by the recent COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the need for efficient resource planning and allocation through the prediction of future consumption. Machine learning can predict resource utilization such as the need for hospitalization based on past medical data stored in electronic medical records (EMR). We conducted this study on 3194 patients (46% male with mean age 56.7 (±16.8), 56% African American, 7% Hispanic) flagged as COVID-19 positive cases in 12 centers under Emory Healthcare network from February 2020 to September 2020, to assess whether a COVID-19 positive patient’s need for hospitalization can be predicted at the time of RT-PCR test using the EMR data prior to the test. Five main modalities of EMR, i.e., demographics, medication, past medical procedures, comorbidities, and laboratory results, were used as features for predictive modeling, both individually and fused together using late, middle, and early fusion. Models were evaluated in terms of precision, recall, F1-score (within 95% confidence interval). The early fusion model is the most effective predictor with 84% overall F1-score [CI 82.1–86.1]. The predictive performance of the model drops by 6 % when using recent clinical data while omitting the long-term medical history. Feature importance analysis indicates that history of cardiovascular disease, emergency room visits in the past year prior to testing, and demographic factors are predictive of the disease trajectory. We conclude that fusion modeling using medical history and current treatment data can forecast the need for hospitalization for patients infected with COVID-19 at the time of the RT-PCR test.

AB  - Inspired by the "Cognitive Hour-glass" model presented in https://doi.org/10.1515/jagi-2016-0001, we propose a new framework for developing cognitive architectures aimed at cognitive robotics. The purpose of the proposed framework is foremost to ease the development of cognitive architectures by encouraging and mitigating cooperation and re-use of existing results. This is done by proposing a framework dividing the development of cognitive architectures into a series of layers that can be considered partly in isolation, and some of which directly relate to other research fields. Finally, we give introductions to and review some topics essential to the proposed framework.

AB  - <jats:p>Neonatal death is still a concerning reality for underdeveloped and even for some of the developed countries. Worldwide data indicate that 26.693 babies out of 1,000 births according to Macro Trades. To reduce the death early prediction of endangered baby is crucial. An early prediction enables the opportunity to take ample care of the child and mother so that an early child death can be avoided. Machine learning was used to figure out whether a newborn baby is at risk. To train the predictive model historical data of 1.4 million newborn child data was used. Machine learning and deep learning techniques such as Logical regression, K nearest neighbor, Random Forest classifier, Extreme gradient boosting (XGboost), convolutional neural network, long short-term memory (LSTM). were implemented using the dataset to find out the most robust model which model is the most accurate to identify the mortality of a newborn. From all the machine learning algorithms, the XGboost and random classifier had the best accuracy with 94%, and from the deep learning model, the LSTM had the best outcome with 99% accuracy. Thus, using LSTM of the model shall be best suited to predict whether precaution for a child is necessary.</jats:p>

AB  - A company's most valuable resource is its workforce, which includes each worker. Because of the crucial role that employees play in the success of an organization, measuring employee turnover rate has become one of the most important metrics that businesses are concentrating on in the modern era. Attrition may occasionally arise owing to unavoidable circumstances such as moving to a distant place, retirement, etc. But when attrition begins creating holes in the pockets of an organization, it is necessary to monitor the situation closely. When hiring new staff, a company must use a significant quantity of its available resources. The process of rehiring employees needs to be eliminated, and a strong workforce needs to be maintained, so it is necessary to adapt the analysis of systematic machine learning models. From these models, a suitable model that gauges the risk of attrition may then be selected. This not only helps an organization save money by preserving its resources but also assists in preserving the status quo of its staff.

AB  - The gradual sprawl of power system toward smart grid and enhanced integration of distributed energy resources at the distribution end is transforming the conventional distribution system and is eventually making it self-sustained. The distribution system is thus continuously evolving to prepare itself for any unforeseen natural, man-made, and complex events. These events may impact the distribution system as high-impact low-frequency (HILF) scenarios. The high intensity and widespread damage of the power system due to HILF scenarios necessitate resilience. Resilience analysis aims to identify these regionspecific vulnerabilities of the electricity network and implement appropriate methods to quickly restore the system to its predisturbance state. Further to enhance the network visibility and situational awareness, integration of synchrophasor to resilience is significant. Therefore, synchrophasor technology integrated with resilience provides online wide area visibility of the distribution system. Using synchrophasor for resilience assessment propels an agile network for coordinating accurate and timely analysis of the system parameters. Therefore, understanding the concept of resilience, its evolution, detailed overview, synchrophasor-based resilience (SBR) methods as well as its applications are necessary. This article outlines the key points of the synchrophasor technology based resilience technique, its significance, and lays a foundation for continuing research in this area. It offers detailed insight into the comprehensive review of this evolving concept. The article majorly focuses on all the aspects of SBR, its necessity in performance evaluation, synchrophasor

AB  - It is difficult for clinicians or less-experienced ophthalmologists to detect early eye-related diseases. By hand, eye disease diagnosis is labor-intensive, prone to mistakes, and challenging because of the variety of ocular diseases such as glaucoma (GA), diabetic retinopathy (DR), cataract (CT), and normal eye-related diseases (NL). An automated ocular disease detection system with computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) tools is required to recognize eye-related diseases. Nowadays, deep learning (DL) algorithms enhance the classification results of retinograph images. To address these issues, we developed an intelligent detection system based on retinal fundus images. To create this system, we used ODIR and RFMiD datasets, which included various retinographics of distinct classes of the fundus, using cutting-edge image classification algorithms like ensemble-based transfer learning. In this paper, we suggest a three-step hybrid ensemble model that combines a classifier, a feature extractor, and a feature selector. The original image features are first extracted using a pre-trained AlexNet model with an enhanced structure. The improved AlexNet (iAlexNet) architecture with attention and dense layers offers enhanced feature extraction, task adaptability, interpretability, and potential accuracy benefits compared to other transfer learning architectures, making it particularly suited for tasks like retinograph classification. The extracted features are then selected using the ReliefF method, and then the most crucial elements are chosen to minimize the feature dimension. Finally, an XgBoost classifier offers classification outcomes based on the desired features. These classifications represent different ocular illnesses. We utilized data augmentation techniques to control class imbalance issues. The deep-ocular model, based mainly on the AlexNet-ReliefF-XgBoost model, achieves an accuracy of 95.13%. The results indicate the proposed ensemble model can assist dermatologists in making early decisions for the diagnosing and screening of eye-related diseases.

Despite extensive research, the mechanisms underlying the diversity of neuronal and glial tau pathology in different tauopathies are poorly understood. While there is a growing understanding of tauopathy-specific differences in tau isoforms and fibrillar structures, the specific composition of heterogenous tau lesions remains unknown. Here we study the protein composition of tau aggregates in four major tauopathies: Alzheimer's disease (AD), corticobasal degeneration (CBD), Pick's disease (PiD), and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP).</AbstractText>

We used ProPPr for the analysis of proteomes associated with AT8-positive cellular lesions from frontal cortices. Isolated proximity proteomes were analyzed by data-independent acquisition mass spectrometry. Co-immunofluorescence staining and quantitative data analysis for selected proteins in human brain tissue was performed to further investigate associations with diverse tau pathologies.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="RESULTS">Proteomics data analysis identified numerous common and tauopathy-specific proteins associated with phospho-tau aggregates. Extensive validations of candidates through quantitative immunofluorescence imaging of distinct aggregates across disease cases demonstrate successful implementation of ProPPr for unbiased discovery of aggregate-associated proteins in in human brain tissue. Our results reveal the association of retromer complex component vacuolar protein sorting-associated protein 35 (VPS35) and lysosome-associated membrane glycoprotein 2 (LAMP2) with specific types of phospho-tau lesions in tauopathies. Furthermore, we discovered a disease-specific association of certain proteins with distinct pathological lesions, including glycogen synthase kinase alpha (GSK3α), ferritin light chain (FTL), and the neuropeptide precursor VGF. Notably, the identification of FTL-positive microglia in CBD astrocytic plaques indicate their potential role in the pathogenesis of these lesions.</AbstractText>

AB  - Most developing countries suffer from inadequate health care facilities and a lack of medical practitioners as most of them emigrate to developed countries. The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has left these countries more vulnerable to facing the worse outcome of the pandemic. This necessitates the need for a system that continuously monitors patient status and detects how their physiological variables will change over time. As a result, it will reduce the rate of mortality and mitigate the need for medical practitioners to monitor patients continuously. In this work, we show how an autoencoder and extreme gradient boosting can be merged to forecast physiological variables of a patient and detect anomalies and their level of divergence. An accurate detection of current and future anomalies will enable remedial action to be taken by medical practitioners at the right time and possibly save lives.

AB  - <AbstractText Label="PURPOSE" NlmCategory="OBJECTIVE">First trimester miscarriage is a major concern in IVF-ET treatments, accounting for one out of nine clinical pregnancies and for up to one out of three recognized pregnancies. To develop a machine learning classifier for predicting the risk of cleavage-stage embryos to undergo first trimester miscarriage based on time-lapse images of preimplantation development.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="METHODS" NlmCategory="METHODS">Retrospective study of a 4-year multi-center cohort of 391 women undergoing intra-cytoplasmatic sperm injection (ICSI) and fresh single or double embryo transfers. The study included embryos with positive indication of clinical implantation based on gestational sac visualization either with first trimester miscarriage or live-birth outcome. Miscarriage was determined based on negative fetal heartbeat indication during the first trimester. Data were recorded and obtained in hospital setting and research was performed in university setting.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="RESULTS">A minimal subset of six non-redundant morphodynamic features were screened that maintained high prediction capacity. Features that account for the distribution of the nucleolus precursor bodies within the small pronucleus and pronuclei dynamics were highly predictive of miscarriage outcome as evaluated using the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) methodology. Using this feature subset, XGBoost and random forest models were trained following a 100-fold Monte-Carlo cross validation scheme. Miscarriage was predicted with AUC 0.68 to 0.69.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="CONCLUSION" NlmCategory="CONCLUSIONS">We report the development of a decision-support tool for identifying the embryos with high risk of miscarriage. Prioritizing embryos for transfer based on their predicted risk of miscarriage in combination with their predicted implantation potential is expected to improve live-birth rates and shorten time-to-pregnancy.</AbstractText>

AB  - Network Function Virtualization (NFV) is the key technology that allows modern network operators to provide flexible and efficient services, by leveraging on general-purpose private cloud infrastructures. In this work, we investigate the performance of a number of metric forecasting techniques based on machine learning and artificial intelligence, and provide insights on how they can support the decisions of NFV operation teams. Our analysis focuses on both infrastructure-level and service-level metrics. The former can be fetched directly from the monitoring system of an NFV infrastructure, whereas the latter are typically provided by the monitoring components of the individual virtualized network functions. Our selected forecasting techniques are experimentally evaluated using real-life data, exported from a production environment deployed within some Vodafone NFV data centers. The results show what the compared techniques can achieve in terms of the forecasting accuracy and computational cost required to train them on production data.

AB  - Software reuse is an essential practice to increase efficiency and reduce costs in software production. Software reuse practices range from reusing artifacts, libraries, components, packages, and APIs. Identifying suitable software for reuse requires pinpointing potential candidates. However, there are no objective methods in place to measure software reuse. This makes it challenging to identify highly reusable software. Software reuse research mainly addresses two hurdles: 1) identifying reusable candidates effectively and efficiently, and 2) selecting high-quality software components that improve maintainability and extensibility. This paper proposes automating software reuse prediction by leveraging machine learning (ML) algorithms, enabling future research and practitioners to better identify highly reusable software. Our approach uses cross-project code clone detection to establish the ground truth for software reuse, identifying code clones across popular GitHub projects as indicators of potential reuse candidates. Software metrics were extracted from Maven artifacts and used to train classification and regression models to predict and estimate software reuse. The average F1-score of the ML classification models is 77.19%. The best-performing model, Ridge Regression, achieved an F1-score of 79.17%. Additionally, this research aims to assist developers by identifying key metrics that significantly impact software reuse. Our findings suggest that the file-level PUA (Public Undocumented API) metric is the most important factor influencing software reuse. We also present suitable value ranges for the top five important metrics that developers can follow to create highly reusable software. Furthermore, we developed a tool that utilizes the trained models to predict the reuse potential of existing GitHub projects and rank Maven artifacts by their domain.

AB  - <jats:p>The overall purpose of this paper is to demonstrate how data preprocessing, training size variation, and subsampling can dynamically change the performance metrics of imbalanced text classification. The methodology encompasses using two different supervised learning classification approaches of feature engineering and data preprocessing with the use of five machine learning classifiers, five imbalanced sampling techniques, specified intervals of training and subsampling sizes, statistical analysis using R and tidyverse on a dataset of 1000 portable document format files divided into five labels from the World Health Organization Coronavirus Research Downloadable Articles of COVID-19 papers and PubMed Central databases of non-COVID-19 papers for binary classification that affects the performance metrics of precision, recall, receiver operating characteristic area under the curve, and accuracy. One approach that involves labeling rows of sentences based on regular expressions significantly improved the performance of imbalanced sampling techniques verified by performing statistical analysis using a t-test documenting performance metrics of iterations versus another approach that automatically labels the sentences based on how the documents are organized into positive and negative classes. The study demonstrates the effectiveness of ML classifiers and sampling techniques in text classification datasets, with different performance levels and class imbalance issues observed in manual and automatic methods of data processing.</jats:p>

AB  - Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have gained popularity due to their low lifecycle cost and minimal human risk, resulting in their widespread use in recent years. In the UAV swarm cooperative decision domain, multi-agent deep reinforcement learning has significant potential. However, current approaches are challenged by the multivariate mission environment and mission time constraints. In light of this, the present study proposes a meta-learning based multi-agent deep reinforcement learning approach that provides a viable solution to this problem. This paper presents an improved MAML-based multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG) algorithm that achieves an unbiased initialization network by automatically assigning weights to meta-learning trajectories. In addition, a Reward-TD prioritized experience replay technique is introduced, which takes into account immediate reward and TD-error to improve the resilience and sample utilization of the algorithm. Experiment results show that the proposed approach effectively accomplishes the task in the new scenario, with significantly improved task success rate, average reward, and robustness compared to existing methods.

AB  - Understanding how social situations unfold in people's daily lives is relevant to designing mobile systems that can support users in their personal goals, well-being, and activities. As an alternative to questionnaires, some studies have used passively collected smartphone sensor data to infer social context (i.e., being alone or not) with machine learning models. However, the few existing studies have focused on specific daily life occasions and limited geographic cohorts in one or two countries. This limits the understanding of how inference models work in terms of generalization to everyday life occasions and multiple countries. In this paper, we used a novel, large-scale, and multimodal smartphone sensing dataset with over 216K self-reports collected from 581 young adults in five countries (Mongolia, Italy, Denmark, UK, Paraguay), first to understand whether social context inference is feasible with sensor data, and then, to know how behavioral and country-level diversity affects inferences. We found that several sensors are informative of social context, that partially personalized multi-country models (trained and tested with data from all countries) and country-specific models (trained and tested within countries) can achieve similar performance above 90% AUC, and that models do not generalize well to unseen countries regardless of geographic proximity. These findings confirm the importance of the diversity of mobile data, to better understand social context inference models in different countries.

AB  - Artificial Intelligence (AI) is one of the hottest topics in our society, especially when it comes to solving data-analysis problems. Industry are conducting their digital shifts, and AI is becoming a cornerstone technology for making decisions out of the huge amount of (sensors-based) data available in the production floor. However, such technology may be disappointing when deployed in real conditions. Despite good theoretical performances and high accuracy when trained and tested in isolation, a Machine-Learning (M-L) model may provide degraded performances in real conditions. One reason may be fragility in treating properly unexpected or perturbed data. The objective of the paper is therefore to study the robustness of seven M-L and Deep-Learning (D-L) algorithms, when classifying univariate time-series under perturbations. A systematic approach is proposed for artificially injecting perturbations in the data and for evaluating the robustness of the models. This approach focuses on two perturbations that are likely to happen during data collection. Our experimental study, conducted on twenty sensors' datasets from the public University of California Riverside (UCR) repository, shows a great disparity of the models' robustness under data quality degradation. Those results are used to analyse whether the impact of such robustness can be predictable-thanks to decision trees-which would prevent us from testing all perturbations scenarios. Our study shows that building such a predictor is not straightforward and suggests that such a systematic approach needs to be used for evaluating AI models' robustness.

AB  - <jats:p>Reverse Logistics is the flow and management of products, packaging, components, and information from the point of consumption (i.e., the market) to the point of origin (i.e., manufacturers and suppliers). It is a collection of practices similar to those of supply chain management, but in the opposite direction, from downstream to upstream. Reverse logistics is a valuable solution to the hazards jeopardizing the environment, and it involves activities such as reuse, repair, remanufacture, refurbish, reclaim and recycle.Reverse logistics became an established line of research, covering several areas, including inventory control; though, several research gaps still exist, such as: ignoring switching costs between production and remanufacturing processes and learning effects, the assumption that production and remanufacturing processes are of perfect quality, remanufactured products are assumed to be as-good-as new, the assumption that returned products are treated as whole products while ignoring disassembly, collection rate of used items is independent of price and quality, and the assumption that pure remanufacturing and production policies are optimal. These research gaps are addressed in mathematical models to bring reverse logistics optimization closer to reality. Deterministic and stochastic components are considered here with numerical examples and results discussed. The key conclusions are as follows:The inclusion of the first time interval where no remanufacturing/repair exists, results in preventing the overestimation of inventory holding costs in the repairable stock. Assuming production and remanufacturing processes to be perfect, or ignoring learning effects in these processes, might not capture the benefits that product recovery programs are supposed to bring. Although works in the literature assumed pure remanufacturing is mathematically attainable but not feasible, this study shows that the pure remanufacturing case is not valid mathematically, which proves it to be infeasible. It is favourable to compensate customers to settle for remanufactured products instead of new ones. Considering disassembly of returns in the modelling of reverse logistics is proven beneficial. Finally, mixed production and remanufacturing policies are optimal rather than pure ones; and the inclusion of price and quality to determine return and collection rates is crucial.</jats:p>

AB  - X-ray imaging is a widely used technique for non-destructive inspection of agricultural food products. One application of X-ray imaging is the autonomous, in-line detection of foreign objects in food samples. Examples of such inclusions are bone fragments in meat products, plastic and metal debris in fish, and fruit infestations. This article presents a processing methodology for unsupervised foreign object detection based on dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA). A novel thickness correction model is introduced as a pre-processing technique for DEXA data. The aim of the model is to homogenize regions in the image that belong to the food product and to enhance contrast where the foreign object is present. In this way, the segmentation of the foreign object is more robust to noise and lack of contrast. The proposed methodology was applied to a dataset of 488 samples of meat products acquired from a conveyor belt. Approximately 60% of the samples contain foreign objects of different types and sizes, while the rest of the samples are void of foreign objects. The results show that samples without foreign objects are correctly identified in 97% of cases and that the overall accuracy of foreign object detection reaches 95%.

AB  - In cognitive neuroscience, computational modeling can formally adjudicate between theories and affords quantitative fits to behavioral/brain data. Pragmatically, however, the space of plausible generative models considered is dramatically limited by the set of models with known likelihood functions. For many models, the lack of a closed-form likelihood typically impedes Bayesian inference methods. As a result, standard models are evaluated for convenience, even when other models might be superior. Likelihood-free methods exist but are limited by their computational cost or their restriction to particular inference scenarios. Here, we propose neural networks that learn approximate likelihoods for arbitrary generative models, allowing fast posterior sampling with only a one-off cost for model simulations that is amortized for future inference. We show that these methods can accurately recover posterior parameter distributions for a variety of neurocognitive process models. We provide code allowing users to deploy these methods for arbitrary hierarchical model instantiations without further training.

AB  - <jats:p>Under the big data era, human beings attach much importance on machine learning. The purpose of this paper is to identify the way to use different methods of machine learning for data analysis and data mining when the companies in lending industry is faced with credit risk. To be specific, the methods are judged from the indicators (e.g., accuracy score and AUC score), and utilized to recognize which loans are bad loans, so as to facilitate the company to make better decisions. The methods including Random Forest, Gaussian Naive Bayes, and Artificial Neural Network are discussed. According to the analysis, all models have an accuracy around 60-70%, while each show different tendency in classifying results. Further optimization that can be applied in the future studies is suggested in the paper. The overall value and reputation of a company will be improved with good credit risk management. Therefore, a good method of credit risk management (e.g., accurately identifying good loans and bad loans) is classifying and analyzing the existing data of the company via different algorithms, and eventually compare them. These results shed light on guiding further exploration of evaluating the creditworthiness in the lending field.</jats:p>

AB  - Antibody generation requires the use of one or more time-consuming methods, namely animal immunization, and in vitro display technologies. However, the recent availability of large amounts of antibody sequence and structural data in the public domain along with the advent of generative deep learning algorithms raises the possibility of computationally generating novel antibody sequences with desirable developability attributes. Here, we describe a deep learning model for computationally generating libraries of highly human antibody variable regions whose intrinsic physicochemical properties resemble those of the variable regions of the marketed antibody-based biotherapeutics (medicine-likeness). We generated 100000 variable region sequences of antigen-agnostic human antibodies belonging to the IGHV3-IGKV1 germline pair using a training dataset of 31416 human antibodies that satisfied our computational developability criteria. The in-silico generated antibodies recapitulate intrinsic sequence, structural, and physicochemical properties of the training antibodies, and compare favorably with the experimentally measured biophysical attributes of 100 variable regions of marketed and clinical stage antibody-based biotherapeutics. A sample of 51 highly diverse in-silico generated antibodies with >90th percentile medicine-likeness and > 90% humanness was evaluated by two independent experimental laboratories. Our data show the in-silico generated sequences exhibit high expression, monomer content, and thermal stability along with low hydrophobicity, self-association, and non-specific binding when produced as full-length monoclonal antibodies. The ability to computationally generate developable human antibody libraries is a first step towards enabling in-silico discovery of antibody-based biotherapeutics. These findings are expected to accelerate in-silico discovery of antibody-based biotherapeutics and expand the druggable antigen space to include targets refractory to conventional antibody discovery methods requiring in vitro antigen production.

AB  - BACKGROUND Although the World Health Organization recommends HIV-exposed infants receive a 6-week diagnostic test, few receive results by 12 weeks. Point-of-care (POC) early infant diagnosis (EID) may improve timely diagnosis and treatment. This study assesses the impact of routine POC versus laboratory-based EID on return of results by 12 weeks of age. METHODS This was a cluster-randomized stepped-wedge trial in Kenya and Zimbabwe. In each country, 18 health facilities were randomly selected for inclusion and randomized to timing of POC implementation. FINDINGS Nine thousand five hundred thirty-nine infants received tests: 5115 laboratory-based and 4424 POC. In Kenya and Zimbabwe, respectively, caregivers were 1.29 times [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.27 to 1.30, P < 0.001] and 4.56 times (95% CI: 4.50 to 4.60, P < 0.001) more likely to receive EID results by 12 weeks of age with POC versus laboratory-based EID. POC significantly reduced the time between sample collection and return of results to caregiver by an average of 23.03 days (95% CI: 4.85 to 21.21, P < 0.001) in Kenya and 62.37 days (95% CI: 58.94 to 65.80, P < 0.001) in Zimbabwe. For HIV-infected infants, POC significantly increased the percentage initiated on treatment, from 43.2% to 79.6% in Zimbabwe, and resulted in a nonsignificant increase in Kenya from 91.7% to 100%. The introduction of POC EID also significantly reduced the time to antiretroviral therapy initiation by an average of 17.01 days (95% CI: 9.38 to 24.64, P < 0.001) in Kenya and 56.00 days (95% CI: 25.13 to 153.76, P < 0.001) in Zimbabwe. CONCLUSIONS POC confers significant advantage on the proportion of caregivers receiving timely EID results, and improves time to results receipt and treatment initiation for infected infants. Where laboratory-based EID systems are unable to deliver results to caregivers rapidly, POC should be implemented as part of an integrated testing system.

AB  - With tracking systems becoming more widespread in sports research and regular training and competitions, more data are available for sports analytics and performance prediction. We analyzed 2523 ski jumps from 205 athletes on five venues. For every jump, the dataset includes the 3D trajectory, 3D velocity, skis' orientation, and metadata such as wind, starting gate, and ski jumping hill data. Using this dataset, we aimed to predict the expected jump length (xLength) inspired by the expected goals metric in soccer (xG). We evaluate the performance of a fully connected neural network, a convolutional neural network (CNN), a long short-term memory (LSTM), and a ResNet architecture to estimate the xLength. For the prediction of the jump length one second after take-off, we achieve a mean absolute error (MAE) of 5.3 m for the generalization to new athletes and an MAE of 5.9 m for the generalization to new ski jumping hills using ResNet architectures. Additionally, we investigated the influence of the input time after the take-off on the predictions' accuracy. As expected, the MAE becomes smaller with longer inputs. Due to the real-time transmission of the sensor's data, xLength can be updated during the flight phase and used in live TV broadcasting. xLength could also be used as an analysis tool for experts to quantify the quality of the take-off and flight phases.

AB  - <jats:p>Recognition of malware is critical in cybersecurity as it allows for avoiding execution and the downloading of malware. One of the possible approaches is to analyze the executable’s Application Programming Interface (API) calls, which can be done using tools that work in sandboxes, such as Cuckoo or CAPEv2. This chain of calls can then be used to classify if the considered file is benign or malware. This work aims to compare six modern shallow learning and deep learning techniques based on tabular data, using two datasets of API calls containing malware and goodware, where the corresponding chain of API calls is expressed for each instance. The results show the quality of shallow learning approaches based on tree ensembles, such as CatBoost, both in terms of F1-macro score and Area Under the ROC curve (AUC ROC), and training time, making them optimal for making inferences on Edge AI solutions. The results are then analyzed with the explainable AI SHAP technique, identifying the API calls that most influence the process, i.e., those that are particularly afferent to malware and goodware.</jats:p>

AB  - <jats:p>Ransomware attacks have increased significantly in recent years, causing great destruction and damage to critical systems and business operations. Attackers are unfailingly finding innovative ways to bypass detection mechanisms, which encouraged the adoption of artificial intelligence. However, most research summarizes the general features of AI and induces many false positives, as the behavior of ransomware constantly differs to bypass detection. Focusing on the key indicating features of ransomware becomes vital as this guides the investigator to the inner workings and main function of ransomware itself. By utilizing access privileges in process memory, the main function of the ransomware can be detected more easily and accurately. Furthermore, new signatures and fingerprints of ransomware families can be identified to classify novel ransomware attacks correctly. The current research used the process memory access privileges of the different memory regions of the behavior of an executable to quickly determine its intent before serious harm can occur. To achieve this aim, several well-known machine learning algorithms were explored with an accuracy range of 81.38% – 96.28%. The study thus confirms the feasibility of utilizing process memory as a detection mechanism for ransomware.</jats:p>

AB  - High blood pressure (BP) may lead to further health complications if not monitored and controlled, especially for critically ill patients. Particularly, there are two types of blood pressure monitoring, invasive measurement, whereby a central line is inserted into the patient’s body, which is associated with infection risks. The second measurement is cuff-based that monitors BP by detecting the blood volume change at the skin surface using a pulse oximeter or wearable devices such as a smartwatch. This paper aims to estimate the blood pressure using machine learning from photoplethysmogram (PPG) signals, which is obtained from cuff-based monitoring. To avoid the issues associated with machine learning such as improperly choosing the classifiers and/or not selecting the best features, this paper utilized the tree-based pipeline optimization tool (TPOT) to automate the machine learning pipeline to select the best regression models for estimating both systolic BP (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP) separately. As a pre-processing stage, notch filter, band-pass filter, and zero phase filtering were applied by TPOT to eliminate any potential noise inherent in the signal. Then, the automated feature selection was performed to select the best features to estimate the BP, including SBP and DBP features, which are extracted using random forest (RF) and k-nearest neighbors (KNN), respectively. To train and test the model, the PhysioNet global dataset was used, which contains 32.061 million samples for 1000 subjects. Finally, the proposed approach was evaluated and validated using the mean absolute error (MAE). The results obtained were 6.52 mmHg for SBS and 4.19 mmHg for DBP, which show the superiority of the proposed model over the related works.

AB  - Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified >30 loci with multiple common noncoding variants explaining interindividual electrocardiographic QT interval (QTi) variation. Of the many types of noncoding functional elements, here we sought to identify transcriptional enhancers with sequence variation and their cognate transcription factors (TFs) that alter the expression of proximal cardiac genes to affect QTi variation. We used massively parallel reporter assays (MPRA) in mouse cardiomyocyte HL-1 cells to screen for functional enhancer variants among 1,018 QTi-associated GWAS variants that overlap candidate cardiac enhancers across 31 loci. We identified 445 GWAS variant-containing enhancers of which 79 showed significant allelic difference in enhancer activity across 21 GWAS loci, with multiple enhancer variants per locus. Of these, we predicted differential binding by cardiac TFs, including AP-1, ATF-1, GATA2, MEF2, NKX2.5, SRF and TBX5 which are known to play key roles in development and homeostasis, at 49 enhancer variants. Finally, we used expression quantitative trait locus mapping and predicted promoter-enhancer contacts to identify 14 candidate target genes through analyses of 36 enhancer variants at 16 loci. This study provides strong evidence for 14 cardiac genes, 10 of them novel, impacting on QTi variation, beyond explaining observed genetic associations.

AB  - The conventional dichotomy between human health and disease has historically been approached through reductionist models that emphasize the exclusive causal relevance of physiological and pathological processes. Consequently, self-awareness and affective dimensions, integral to a phenomenological perspective, are often relegated to secondary traits, affording little consideration for the causal role of embodied living organization. Our interest lies in exploring the potential relevance of the phenomenology of embodied self-awareness in relation to interoceptive processes within therapeutic settings. As we illustrate, when the unfolding processes of interoceptive awareness and its affective capacity take precedence, the agent assumes an active, rather than passive, role in their own experience of health or illness. Departing from an enactive, phenomenological, and ecological standpoint, we propose a distinctive perspective on interoceptive processes, relying on an affective conceptualization of a spectrum of experiences of bodily being-in-the-world. Our primary argument posits that considering interoceptive processes from an embodied and ecological viewpoint of the self, interacting with the material and social environment, enables an approach to the gradient of affective experiences of embodied self-awareness-where pleasure or suffering is perceived and felt-in a naturalized, non-reductive, and relational manner. We discern two ways in which interoceptive processes interrelate with the experience of embodied self-awareness: sensitivity (self-affective) and affective-laden perception. Drawing on this distinction, we provide a nuanced description of these experiences within communities of cis-women, exemplified through the contexts of menstruation and endometriosis. This exploration seeks to enhance our understanding of the phenomenology of embodied, ecological, and affective self-experience from within diverse and situated bodies. The goal is to contribute to their autonomy and ability to adapt and self-regulate within therapeutic contexts.

AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>There has been an explosion of data collected about sports. Because such data is extremely rich and complex, machine learning is increasingly being used to extract actionable insights from it. Typically, machine learning is used to build models and indicators that capture the skills, capabilities, and tendencies of athletes and teams. Such indicators and models are in turn used to inform decision-making at professional clubs. Designing these indicators requires paying careful attention to a number of subtle issues from a methodological and evaluation perspective. In this paper, we highlight these challenges in sports and discuss a variety of approaches for handling them. Methodologically, we highlight that dependencies affect how to perform data partitioning for evaluation as well as the need to consider contextual factors. From an evaluation perspective, we draw a distinction between evaluating the developed indicators themselves versus the underlying models that power them. We argue that both aspects must be considered, but that they require different approaches. We hope that this article helps bridge the gap between traditional sports expertise and modern data analytics by providing a structured framework with practical examples.</jats:p>

          <jats:p>The global sports industry is valued at $480 billion in 2023, projected to rise to $629.81 billion by 2028, with the betting sector alone generating €1.41 trillion in turnover in 2022, €730 billion of which was from football. Football attracts millions of fans worldwide, creating lucrative opportunities for advertising and marketing. In Europe, the Big Five leagues represent most of the European professional sports market. In this context, it is important to be able to evaluate football clubs and players. The value of a football player depends mainly on his performance, which depends on different factors, such as personal characteristics, attacking and defending ability on the pitch, mentality, and much more. This study focuses on attacking performance, specifically Expected Goals (xG), a critical metric for financial and strategic decisions in football, since it helps clubs, investors, and bookmakers to evaluate more accurately team performance and identify value bets. In addition, the xG metric can also significantly influence a player’s market value and transfer decisions. This study has two main objectives: first, we want to identify the current xG model through data from Understat, one of the primary data providers for shot characteristics; then, we want to propose an improved approach for more accurate xG predictions.</jats:p>

        <jats:p>The Expected Goals (xG) is a performance metric used to evaluate a football team's or a player's performance. Simply put, it represents the probability of a scoring opportunity that may result in a goal. This metric suits the low-scoring nature of sports such as football. The score of a match involves randomness and inexplicable factors that skew the data represented by standard metrics and often may not represent the actual performance of an individual or a team; therefore, it would be of more significant benefit to individuals trying to analyse a player or a team to use alternative statistics rather than shots on target, ball possessions percentage, and sprints completed. The xG Model is trained on several key metrics derived from on-field events, corroborating with the historical to measure the probability of a shot being a goal by the common goal. The selection of these features, the size and date of the data, and the model used as the parameters that may affect the model's performance. Using machine learning models to increase the model's predictive performance decreases the vagueness caused by subjective interpretation. This paper proposes an accurate expected goal model trained on a compiled dataset containing data from the FIFA World Cup 2018 and 2022, and the UEFA Champions League 2018-2022, with a total of 768,744 shots taken by the top players take when representing their country and club on the biggest stage. Moreover, this model is explained by using data visualisation tools to obtain an explainable expected goal representation for evaluating a team or player's performance. Moreover, these methods can be generalised to other sports.</jats:p>

AB  - <jats:p>The escalating reliance of modern society on information and communication technology has rendered it vulnerable to an array of cyber-attacks, with distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) at-tacks emerging as one of the most prevalent threats. This paper delves into the intricacies of DDoS attacks, which exploit compromised machines numbering in the thousands or more to disrupt data services and online commercial platforms, resulting in significant downtime and financial losses. Recognizing the gravity of this issue, various detection techniques have been explored, yet the quantitative and prior detection of DDoS attacks has seen a decline in recent methods. This research introduces an innovative approach by integrating evolutionary optimization algorithms and machine learning techniques. Specifically, the study proposes XGB-GA Optimization, RF-GA Optimization, and SVM-GA Optimization methods, employing Evolutionary Algorithms Opti-mization with TOPOT-Genetic Programming. Datasets pertaining to DDoS attacks were utilized to train machine learning models based on XGB, RF, and SVM algorithms, and 10-fold cross-validation was employed. The models were further optimized using evolutionary algo-rithms, achieving remarkable accuracy scores: 99.99% with the XGB-GA method, 99.50% with RF-GA, and 99.99% with SVM-GA. Furthermore, the study employed TPOT to identify the optimal algorithm for constructing a machine learning model, with the genetic algorithm pinpointing XGB-GA as the most effective choice. This research significantly advances the field of DDoS attack detection by presenting a robust and accurate methodology, thereby enhancing the cybersecurity landscape and fortifying digital infrastructures against these pervasive threats.</jats:p>

AB  - Heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems are a popular research topic because buildings' energy is mostly used for heating and/or cooling. These systems heavily rely on sensory measurements and typically make an integral part of the smart building concept. As such, they require the implementation of fault detection and diagnosis (FDD) methodologies, which should assist users in maintaining comfort while consuming minimal energy. Despite the fact that FDD approaches are a well-researched subject, not just for improving the operation of HVAC systems but also for a wider range of systems in industrial processes, there is a lack of application in commercial buildings due to their complexity and low transferability. The aim of this review paper is to present and systematize cutting-edge FDD methodologies, encompassing approaches and special techniques that can be applied in HVAC systems, as well as to provide best-practice heuristics for researchers and solution developers in this domain. While the literature analysis targets the FDD perspective, the main focus is put on the data-driven approach, which covers commonly used models and data pre-processing techniques in the field. Data-driven techniques and FDD solutions based on them, which are most commonly used in recent HVAC research, form the backbone of our study, while alternative FDD approaches are also presented and classified to properly contextualize and round out the review.

AB  - Studies of individual neurons in the Drosophila nervous system are facilitated by transgenic lines that sparsely and repeatably label respective neurons of interest. Sparsity can be enhanced by means of intersectional approaches like the split-GAL4 system, which labels the positive intersection of the expression patterns of two (denser) GAL4 lines. To this end, two GAL4 lines have to be identified as labelling a neuron of interest. Current approaches to tackling this task include visual inspection, as well as automated search in 2d projection images, of single cell multi-color flip-out (MCFO) acquisitions of GAL4 expression patterns. There is to date no automated method available that performs full 3d search in MCFO imagery of GAL4 lines, nor one that leverages automated reconstructions of the labelled neuron morphologies. To close this gap, we propose PatchPerPixMatch, a fully automated approach for finding a given neuron morphology in MCFO acquisitions of Gen1 GAL4 lines. PatchPerPixMatch performs automated instance segmentation of MCFO acquisitions, and subsequently searches for a target neuron morphology by minimizing an objective that aims at covering the target with a set of well-fitting segmentation fragments. Patch-PerPixMatch is computationally efficient albeit being full 3d, while also highly robust to inaccuracies in the automated neuron instance segmentation. We are releasing PatchPerPixMatch search results for ~30,000 neuron morphologies from the Drosophila hemibrain in ~20,000 MCFO acquisitions of ~3,500 Gen1 GAL4 lines.

AB  - With the everyday growth of the Internet of Things (IoT), the number of connected sensor devices increases as well, where each sensor consumes energy while being constantly online. During that time, they collect large amounts of data in short intervals leading to the collection of redundant and perhaps irrelevant data. Moreover, being commonly battery powered, sensor batteries need to be frequently replaced or recharged. The former requires smarter and less frequent data collection, while the latter being complementary to the former requires putting them to sleep while not being used in order to save energy. The focus of this article is low-cost gas sensors as they need to preheat for several minutes to reliably collect gas concentration. However, instead of waiting for a sensor to heat up, a transient, i.e., a data trend that the sensor collects while heating up is analyzed. It is shown that long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network can be used to learn and later predict the actual gas level from a part of the transient. This way, instead of being constantly online or fully preheating, the sensor needs to be turned on for only 20 s and then sleep for 120 s. With high accuracy, our approach decreases energy consumption by up to 85% compared to a system where sensors are constantly online, and more than 50% compared to a system where a sensor collects actual values instead of a part of the transient.

AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>The utility of employing artificial intelligence (AI) to issue tornado warnings is explored using an ensemble of 128 idealized simulations. Over 700 tornadoes develop within the ensemble of simulations, varying in duration, length, and associated storm mode. Machine-learning models are trained to forecast the temporal and spatial probabilities of tornado formation for a specific lead time. The machine-learning probabilities are used to produce tornado warning decisions for each grid point and lead time. An optimization function is defined, such that warning thresholds are modified to optimize the performance of the AI system on a specified metric (e.g., increased lead time, minimized false alarms, etc.). Using genetic algorithms, multiple AI systems are developed with different optimization functions. The different AI systems yield unique warning output depending on the desired attributes of the optimization function. The effects of the different optimization functions on warning performance are explored. Overall, performance is encouraging and suggests that automated tornado warning guidance is worth exploring with real-time data.</jats:p>

AB  - The evolution of network technologies has witnessed a paradigm shift toward open and intelligent networks, with the Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) architecture emerging as a promising solution. O-RAN introduces disaggregation and virtualization, enabling network operators to deploy multi-vendor and interoperable solutions. However, managing and automating the complex O-RAN ecosystem presents numerous challenges. To address this, machine learning (ML) techniques have gained considerable attention in recent years, offering promising avenues for network automation in O-RAN. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of the current research efforts on network automation usingML in O-RAN.We begin by providing an overview of the O-RAN architecture and its key components, highlighting the need for automation. Subsequently, we delve into O-RAN support forML techniques. The survey then explores challenges in network automation usingML within the O-RAN environment, followed by the existing research studies discussing application of ML algorithms and frameworks for network automation in O-RAN. The survey further discusses the research opportunities by identifying important aspects whereML techniques can benefit.

AB  - The sophistication of cyberattacks has significantly increased, making it almost certain that organizations can be victims of cyberattacks at any time. Managing cybersecurity risk is critical for any organization so that informed decisions can be made to tackle risks before they materialize. Cybersecurity risk management is context-specific and heavily relies on the specific organization's context. However, performing effective risk management is always challenging due to the constant changes in organizational infrastructure and security posture, including the adoption of new applications and the reconfiguration or updating of existing assets and their dependencies, as well as the potential exploitation of vulnerabilities. Despite the wider adoption of AI enabled cybersecurity risk management, there is a lack of focus on the integration of these systems along with the dynamic elements of the risk management. In this context, this research proposes a novel dynamic cyber security risk management (d-CSRM) framework to tackle this challenge by integrating dynamic parameters such as vulnerability exploitation and assets dependencies for assessing and managing the risk. The framework consists of a systemic process and makes use of a hybrid AI-enabled model that combines both linear regression and deep learning, to prioritize the vulnerabilities. Additionally, d-CSRM integrates the explainability and interpretability characteristics of the AI model for explaining model decision making and the inner working parameters. This allows the extraction of the key features that are linked with the risk and informed decision making to tackle the risks. An experiment was performed to prioritize the vulnerabilities from the widely used CVEjoin dataset using the proposed hybrid model to quantify the dynamic risk with explainability. The results show that the hybrid model effectively identifies and prioritizes the most critical vulnerabilities using the selected key features such as exploit type, exploit platform and impact that can further enhance the dynamic risk assessment.

AB  - <jats:p>Now the world is becoming more sophisticated and networked, and a massive amount of data is being generated daily. For energy management in residential and commercial properties, it is essential to know how much energy each appliance uses. The forecast would be more clear and practical if the task is based purely on energy usage data. But in the real world, it’s not the case, energy consumption is strongly dependent on weather and surroundings also. In a home appliances network when measured/observed data is available then algorithms of supervised-based machine learning provide an immeasurable alternative to the annoyance associated with many engineering and data mining methodologies. The patterns of household energy consumption are changing based on temperature, humidity, hour of the day, etc. For predicting household energy consumption feature engineering is performed, and models are trained by using different machine learning algorithms such as Linear Regression, Lasso Regression, Random Forest, Extra Tree Regressor, XG Boost, etc.. To evaluate the models R square is used as the forecasting is based on time. R square tells how much percentage of variance in the dependent variable can be predicted. Finally, it is suggested that tree-based models are giving best results.</jats:p>

AB  - Deep generative models have become an emerging topic in various research areas like computer vision and signal processing. These models allow synthesizing realistic data samples that are of great value for both academic and industrial communities. Affective computing, a topic of a broad interest in computer vision society, has been no exception and has benefited from this powerful approach. In fact, affective computing observed a rapid derivation of generative models during the last two decades. Applications of such models include but are not limited to emotion recognition and classification, unimodal emotion synthesis, and cross-modal emotion synthesis. As a result, we conducted a comprehensive survey of recent advances in human emotion synthesis by studying available databases, advantages, and disadvantages of the generative models along with the related training strategies considering two principal human communication modalities, namely audio and video. In this context, facial expression synthesis, speech emotion synthesis, and the audio-visual (cross-modal) emotion synthesis are reviewed extensively under different application scenarios. Gradually, we discuss open research problems to push the boundaries of this research area for future works. As conclusions, we indicate common problems that can be explored from the Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) topologies and applications in emotion synthesis.

AB  - <jats:p>&lt;p&gt;Molecular materials are challenging to design as their packing arrangement and hence properties are subject to subtle variations in the interplay of soft intermolecular interactions that are difficult to predict. The rational design of new molecular materials with tailored properties is currently hampered by the lack of knowledge of how a candidate molecule will pack in space and how we can control the polymorphs we can experimentally obtain. Here, we develop a simplified approach to aid the material design process, by the development of a screening process that is used to test 1344 helicene molecules that have potential as organic electronic materials. Our approach bridges the gap between single molecule design, molecular assembly, and the resulting charge-carrier mobilities. We find that fluorination significantly improves electron transport in the molecular material by up to 200%; the reference [6]helicene packing showed a mobility of 0.30 cm2 V-1 s-1, fluorination increased the mobility to up to 0.96 and 0.97 (13-fluoro[6]H and 4,13-difluoro[6]H), assuming an outer reorganisation energy of 0.30 eV. Side groups containing triple bonds largely lead to improved transfer integrals. We validate our screening approach through the use of crystal structure prediction to confirm the presence of favourable packing motifs to maximize charge mobility.&lt;/p&gt;</jats:p>

AB  - Robotic navigation has been approached as a problem of 3D reconstruction and planning, as well as an end-to-end learning problem. However, long-range navigation requires both planning and reasoning about local traversability, as well as being able to utilize general knowledge about global geography, in the form of a roadmap, GPS, or other side information providing important cues. In this work, we propose an approach that integrates learning and planning, and can utilize side information such as schematic roadmaps, satellite maps and GPS coordinates as a planning heuristic, without relying on them being accurate. Our method, ViKiNG, incorporates a local traversability model, which looks at the robot's current camera observation and a potential subgoal to infer how easily that subgoal can be reached, as well as a heuristic model, which looks at overhead maps for hints and attempts to evaluate the appropriateness of these subgoals in order to reach the goal. These models are used by a heuristic planner to identify the best waypoint in order to reach the final destination. Our method performs no explicit geometric reconstruction, utilizing only a topological representation of the environment. Despite having never seen trajectories longer than 80 meters in its training dataset, ViKiNG can leverage its image-based learned controller and goal-directed heuristic to navigate to goals up to 3 kilometers away in previously unseen environments, and exhibit complex behaviors such as probing potential paths and backtracking when they are found to be non-viable. ViKiNG is also robust to unreliable maps and GPS, since the low-level controller ultimately makes decisions based on egocentric image observations, using maps only as planning heuristics.

AB  - Drug combination therapies have been a viable strategy for the treatment of complex diseases such as cancer due to increased efficacy and reduced side effects. However, experimentally validating all possible combinations for synergistic interaction even with high-throughout screens is intractable due to vast combinatorial search space. Computational techniques can reduce the number of combinations to be evaluated experimentally by prioritizing promising candidates. We present MatchMaker that predicts drug synergy scores using drug chemical structure information and gene expression profiles of cell lines in a deep learning framework. For the first time, our model utilizes the largest known drug combination dataset to date, DrugComb. We compare the performance of MatchMaker with the state-of-the-art models and observe up to 15% correlation and 33% mean squared error (MSE) improvements over the next best method. We investigate the cell types and drug pairs that are relatively harder to predict and present novel candidate pairs. MatchMaker is built and available at https://github.com/tastanlab/matchmaker.

AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>ADAS (Advanced Driver Assistance Systems) are becoming increasingly popular in on-road vehicles due to their safety, productivity, and cost savings. In the same way, off-road vehicles can benefit from ADAS systems to improve the security of drivers and workers in industrial settings. In this work, we study, design, and develop a novel security system to be integrated into industrial vehicles. This system is built to provide one-way Human Computer Interaction, from the computer to the human, so providing, through the interaction with the ADAS system, feedback to drivers about their surroundings, such as nearby workers, and thus helping to avoid collisions and prevent incidents. The study evaluates the quality of different feedback mechanisms, with the goal of designing the ADAS that produces the best User eXperience (UX). These feedback mechanisms are generated by LEDs in different display formats and colors, as well as with haptic feedback. We created a hybrid testbed using a realistic ADAS and a forklift simulator, integrating the system into a physical structure that resembles an industrial vehicle (a forklift) and used a computer-based simulation of a warehouse to gather the information from users. We performed a study with 36 people for the evaluation of the different feedback mechanisms tested, evaluating the results both from an objective point of view based on the results of the simulation, and a subjective point of view through a questionnaire and the stress of the users in each test.</jats:p>

AB  - Privacy-preserving data mining techniques are useful for analyzing various information, such as Internet of Things data and COVID-19-related patient data. However, collecting a large amount of sensitive personal information is a challenging task. In addition, this information may have missing values, which are not considered in the existing methods for collecting personal information while ensuring data privacy. Failure to account for missing values reduces the accuracy of the data analysis. In this paper, we propose a method for privacy-preserving data collection that considers many missing values. The patient data are anonymized and sent to a data collection server. The data collection server creates a generative model and a contingency table suitable for multi-attribute analysis based on expectation-maximization and Gaussian copula methods. Using differential privacy (the de facto standard) as a privacy metric, we conduct experiments on synthetic and real data, including COVID-19-related data. The results are 50--80\% more accurate than those of existing methods that do not consider missing values.

AB  - Copper-based nanocrystals are reference nanomaterials for integration into emerging green technologies, with laser ablation in liquid (LAL) being a remarkable technique for their synthesis. However, the achievement of a specific type of nanocrystal, among the whole library of nanomaterials available using LAL, has been until now an empirical endeavor based on changing synthesis parameters and characterizing the products. Here, we started from the bibliographic analysis of LAL synthesis of Cu-based nanocrystals to identify the relevant physical and chemical features for the predetermination of copper oxidation state. First, single features and their combinations were screened by linear regression analysis, also using a genetic algorithm, to find the best correlation with experimental output and identify the equation giving the best prediction of the LAL results. Then, machine learning (ML) models were exploited to unravel cross-correlations between features that are hidden in the linear regression analysis. Although the LAL-generated Cu nanocrystals may be present in a range of oxidation states, from metallic copper to cuprous oxide (Cu<sub>2</sub>O) and cupric oxide (CuO), in addition to the formation of other materials such as Cu<sub>2</sub>S and CuCN, ML was able to guide the experiments toward the maximization of the compounds in the greatest demand for integration in sustainable processes. This approach is of general applicability to other nanomaterials and can help understand the origin of the chemical pathways of nanocrystals generated by LAL, providing a rational guideline for the conscious predetermination of laser-synthesis parameters toward the desired compounds.

AB  - Research and medical genomics require comprehensive and scalable solutions to drive the discovery of novel disease targets, evolutionary drivers, and genetic markers with clinical significance. This necessitates a framework to identify all types of variants independent of their size (e.g., SNV/SV) or location (e.g., repeats). Here we present DRAGEN that utilizes novel methods based on multigenomes, hardware acceleration, and machine learning based variant detection to provide novel insights into individual genomes with ~30min computation time (from raw reads to variant detection). DRAGEN outperforms all other state-of-the-art methods in speed and accuracy across all variant types (SNV, indel, STR, SV, CNV) and further incorporates specialized methods to obtain key insights in medically relevant genes (e.g., HLA, SMN, GBA). We showcase DRAGEN across 3,202 genomes and demonstrate its scalability, accuracy, and innovations to further advance the integration of comprehensive genomics for research and medical applications.

AB  - Author(s): Yao, J; Lin, L; Bukov, M | Abstract: The quantum alternating operator ansatz (QAOA) is a prominent example of variational quantum algorithms. We propose a generalized QAOA called CD-QAOA, which is inspired by the counterdiabatic driving procedure, designed for quantum many-body systems and optimized using a reinforcement learning (RL) approach. The resulting hybrid control algorithm proves versatile in preparing the ground state of quantum-chaotic many-body spin chains by minimizing the energy. We show that using terms occurring in the adiabatic gauge potential as generators of additional control unitaries, it is possible to achieve fast high-fidelity many-body control away from the adiabatic regime. While each unitary retains the conventional QAOA-intrinsic continuous control degree of freedom such as the time duration, we consider the order of the multiple available unitaries appearing in the control sequence as an additional discrete optimization problem. Endowing the policy gradient algorithm with an autoregressive deep learning architecture to capture causality, we train the RL agent to construct optimal sequences of unitaries. The algorithm has no access to the quantum state, and we find that the protocol learned on small systems may generalize to larger systems. By scanning a range of protocol durations, we present numerical evidence for a finite quantum speed limit in the nonintegrable mixed-field spin- Ising and Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick models, and for the suitability to prepare ground states of the spin-1 Heisenberg chain in the long-range and topologically ordered parameter regimes. This work paves the way to incorporate recent success from deep learning for the purpose of quantum many-body control.

AB  - Brain machine interfaces (BMIs), or brain computer interfaces (BCIs), are devices that act as a medium for communications between the brain and the computer. It is an emerging field with numerous applications in domains of prosthetic devices, robotics, communication technology, gaming, education, and security. It is noted in such a multidisciplinary field, many reviews have surveyed on various focused subfields of interest, such as neural signaling, microelectrode fabrication, and signal classification algorithms. A unified review is lacking to cover and link all the relevant areas in this field. Herein, this review intends to connect on the relevant areas that circumscribe BMIs to present a unified script that may help enhance our understanding of BMIs. Specifically, this article discusses signal generation within the cortex, signal acquisition using invasive, non-invasive, or hybrid techniques, and the signal processing domain. The latest development is surveyed in this field, particularly in the last decade, with discussions regarding the challenges and possible solutions to allow swift disruption of BMI products in the commercial market.

AB  - According to prior work, the type of relationship between a person consuming alcohol and others in the surrounding (friends, family, spouse, etc.), and the number of those people (alone, with one person, with a group) are related to many aspects of alcohol consumption, such as the drinking amount, location, motives, and mood. Even though the social context is recognized as an important aspect that influences the drinking behavior of young adults in alcohol research, relatively little work has been conducted in smartphone sensing research on this topic. In this study, we analyze the weekend nightlife drinking behavior of 241 young adults in a European country, using a dataset consisting of self-reports and passive smartphone sensing data over a period of three months. Using multiple statistical analyses, we show that features from modalities such as accelerometer, location, application usage, bluetooth, and proximity could be informative about different social contexts of drinking. We define and evaluate seven social context inference tasks using smartphone sensing data, obtaining accuracies of the range 75%-86% in four two-class and three three-class inferences. Further, we discuss the possibility of identifying the sex composition of a group of friends using smartphone sensor data with accuracies over 70%. The results are encouraging towards supporting future interventions on alcohol consumption that incorporate users' social context more meaningfully and reducing the need for user self-reports when creating drink logs for self-tracking tools and public health studies.

AB  - The popularity of tools for analyzing Technical Debt, and particularly the popularity of SonarQube, is increasing rapidly. SonarQube proposes a set of coding rules, which represent something wrong in the code that will soon be reflected in a fault or will increase maintenance effort. However, our local companies were not confident in the usefulness of the rules proposed by SonarQube and contracted us to investigate the fault-proneness of these rules. In this work we aim at understanding which SonarQube rules are actually fault-prone and to understand which machine learning models can be adopted to accurately identify fault-prone rules. We designed and conducted an empirical study on 21 well-known mature open-source projects. We applied the SZZ algorithm to label the fault-inducing commits. We analyzed the fault-proneness by comparing the classification power of seven machine learning models. Among the 202 rules defined for Java by SonarQube, only 25 can be considered to have relatively low fault-proneness. Moreover, violations considered as “bugs” by SonarQube were generally not fault-prone and, consequently, the fault-prediction power of the model proposed by SonarQube is extremely low. The rules applied by SonarQube for calculating technical debt should be thoroughly investigated and their harmfulness needs to be further confirmed. Therefore, companies should carefully consider which rules they really need to apply, especially if their goal is to reduce fault-proneness.

AB  - Nitrogen is one of the key nutrients that indicate soil quality and an important component for plant development. Accurate knowledge and management of soil nitrogen is crucial for food security in rural communities, especially for smallholder maize farms. However, less research has been done on generating digital soil nitrogen maps for these farmers. This study examines the utility of Sentinel-2 satellite data and environmental variables to map soil nitrogen at smallholder maize farms. Three machine learning algorithms—random forest (RF), gradient boosting (GB), and extreme gradient boosting (XG) were investigated for this purpose. The findings indicate that the RF (R2 = 0.90, RMSE = 0.0076%) model performs slightly better than the GB (R2 = 0.88, RMSE = 0.0083%) and XG (R2 = 0.89, RMSE = 0.0077%) models. Furthermore, the variable importance measure showed that the Sentinel-2 bands, particularly the red and red-edge bands, have a superior performance in comparison to the environmental variables and soil indices. The digital maps generated in this study show the high capability of Sentinel-2 satellite data to generate accurate nitrogen content maps with the application of machine learning. The developed framework can be implemented to map the spatial pattern of soil nitrogen. This will also contribute to soil fertility interventions and nitrogen fertilization management to improve food security in rural communities. This application contributes to Sustainable Development Goal number 2.

AB  - Abstract. The atmospheric products of the Multi-Angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction (MAIAC) algorithm include column water vapor (CWV) at 1 km resolution, derived from daily overpasses of NASA’s Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) instruments aboard the Aqua and Terra satellites. We have recently shown that machine learning using extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) can improve the estimation of MAIAC aerosol optical depth (AOD). Although MAIAC CWV is generally well validated (Pearson’s R > 0.97 versus CWV from AERONET sun photometers), it has not yet been assessed whether machine-learning approaches can further improve CWV. Using a novel spatiotemporal cross-validation approach to avoid overfitting, our XGBoost model with nine features derived from land use terms, date, and ancillary variables from the MAIAC retrieval, quantifies and can correct a substantial portion of measurement error relative to collocated measures at AERONET sites (26.9 % and 16.5 % decrease in Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) for Terra and Aqua datasets, respectively) in the Northeastern USA, 2000–2015. We use machine-learning interpretation tools to illustrate complex patterns of measurement error and describe a positive bias in MAIAC Terra CWV worsening in recent summertime conditions. We validate our predictive model on MAIAC CWV estimates at independent stations from the SuomiNet GPS network where our corrections decrease the RMSE by 19.7 % and 9.5 % for Terra and Aqua MAIAC CWV. Empirically correcting for measurement error with machine-learning algorithms is a post-processing opportunity to improve satellite-derived CWV data for Earth science and remote sensing applications.

AB  - Blasting operations in open-cast mines, while essential for mineral extraction, can generate significant peak particle velocity (PPV), posing environmental and structural risks. Accurate PPV prediction is critical to mitigate these effects and optimize blasting practices. This review introduces a hybrid ML approach that combines traditional methods, such as decision trees and SVMs, with advanced techniques like ensemble learning and neural networks. The performance of these models is evaluated based on blast parameters, geographical conditions, and monitoring data. The study highlights that hybrid and ensemble methods outperform other techniques in the majority of cases, especially in surface blasting scenarios. The increasing use of these advanced methods underscores their potential to address key challenges in blasting operations. Hybrid machine learning models over traditional methods by combining the strengths of multiple algorithms, effectively reducing bias and variance while enhancing predictive accuracy. Unlike conventional models, which often struggle with nonlinear relationships and high-dimensional data, hybrid approaches leverage advanced feature engineering, ensemble learning, and optimization techniques to improve robustness and generalization. In our study, these models demonstrated superior reliability in predicting PPV, achieving higher accuracy in terms of RMSE and . By combining different techniques, they mitigate individual model weaknesses, reduce errors, and improve feature selection. In addition, hybrid models prevent overfitting and optimize predictions through ensemble strategies such as boosting and stacking. This study explores the advantages of hybrid ML models, demonstrating their superior performance compared to conventional approaches. The review also identifies gaps in research on underground blasting and suggests future directions, emphasizing the importance of ongoing technological advancements and industry awareness of ML techniques benefits. Enhanced accuracy and robustness in PPV prediction, driven by hybrid approaches and real-time systems, are crucial to improve safety and efficiency in mining operations.

AB  - <jats:title>Background</jats:title><jats:p>Tree ensemble machine learning models are increasingly used in microbiome science as they are compatible with the compositional, high-dimensional, and sparse structure of sequence-based microbiome data. While such models are often good at predicting phenotypes based on microbiome data, they only yield limited insights into how microbial taxa or genomic content may be associated. Results: We developed endoR, a method to interpret a fitted tree ensemble model. First, endoR simplifies the fitted model into a decision ensemble from which it then extracts information on the importance of individual features and their pairwise interactions and also visualizes these data as an interpretable network. Both the network and importance scores derived from endoR provide insights into how features, and interactions between them, contribute to the predictive performance of the fitted model. Adjustable regularization and bootstrapping help reduce the complexity and ensure that only essential parts of the model are retained. We assessed the performance of endoR on both simulated and real metagenomic data. We found endoR to infer true associations with more or comparable accuracy than other commonly used approaches while easing and enhancing model interpretation. Using endoR, we also confirmed published results on gut microbiome differences between cirrhotic and healthy individuals. Finally, we utilized endoR to gain insights into components of the microbiome that predict the presence of human gut methanogens, as these hydrogen-consumers are expected to interact with fermenting bacteria in a complex syntrophic network. Specifically, we analyzed a global metagenome dataset of 2203 individuals and confirmed the previously reported association between<jats:italic>Methanobacteriaceae</jats:italic>and<jats:italic>Christensenellales</jats:italic>. Additionally, we observed that<jats:italic>Methanobacteriaceae</jats:italic>are associated with a network of hydrogen-producing bacteria. Conclusion: Our method accurately captures how tree ensembles use features and interactions between them to predict a response. As demonstrated by our applications, the resultant visualizations and summary outputs facilitate model interpretation and enable the generation of novel hypotheses about complex systems. An implementation of endoR is available as an open-source R-package on GitHub (<jats:ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/leylabmpi/endoR">https://github.com/leylabmpi/endoR</jats:ext-link>).</jats:p>

AB  - Advances in remote sensing combined with the emergence of sophisticated methods for large-scale data analytics from the field of data science provide new methods to model complex interactions in biological systems. Using a data-driven philosophy, insights from experts are used to corroborate the results generated through analytical models instead of leading the model design. Following such an approach, this study outlines the development and implementation of a whole-of-forest phenotyping system that incorporates spatial estimates of productivity across a large plantation forest. In large-scale plantation forestry, improving the productivity and consistency of future forests is an important but challenging goal due to the multiple interactions between biotic and abiotic factors, the long breeding cycle, and the high variability of growing conditions. Forest phenotypic expression is highly affected by the interaction of environmental conditions and forest management but the understanding of this complex dynamics is incomplete. In this study, we collected an extensive set of 2.7 million observations composed of 62 variables describing climate, forest management, tree genetics, and fine-scale terrain information extracted from environmental surfaces, management records, and remotely sensed data. Using three machine learning methods, we compared models of forest productivity and evaluate the gain and Shapley values for interpreting the influence of categorical variables on the power of these methods to predict forest productivity at a landscape level. The most accurate model identified that the most important drivers of productivity were, in order of importance, genetics, environmental conditions, leaf area index, topology, and soil properties, thus describing the complex interactions of the forest. This approach demonstrates that new methods in remote sensing and data science enable powerful, landscape-level understanding of forest productivity. The phenotyping method developed here can be used to identify superior and inferior genotypes and estimate a productivity index for individual site. This approach can improve tree breeding and deployment of the right genetics to the right site in order to increase the overall productivity across planted forests.

AB  - <p>Protests can have an impact on newspaper coverage, not only by prompting reports about the protest events themselves, but also by bringing attention to the issue that they are concerned with. But they may also have negative impacts by distracting from existing constructive discourse on the issue. Quantitative media analyses can uncover these impacts. The problem is that protests and media coverage are in a complex causal relation: They mutually influence each other, and external events may cause both protests and coverage to increase at the same time. To deal with observed and unobserved confounding, I evaluate multiple causal methods: Besides the classical repertoire of regression and instrumental variables, I investigate aggregated synthetic controls and inverse propensity weighting. I show that all methods reduce bias but do not completely remove it, except perhaps the synthetic control method. My analysis of climate protest events in Germany shows that the protests generally tend to increase not only protest-related coverage but also other coverage related to climate change; but there are differences between the various protest groups. This sheds empirical light on a theoretical debate about possible backfiring effects.</p>

AB  - Sepsis is one of the main causes of death in critically ill patients. Despite the continuous development of medical technology in recent years, its morbidity and mortality are still high. This is mainly related to the delay in starting treatment and non-adherence of clinical guidelines. Artificial intelligence (AI) is an evolving field in medicine, which has been used to develop a variety of innovative Clinical Decision Support Systems. It has shown great potential in predicting the clinical condition of patients and assisting in clinical decision-making. AI-derived algorithms can be applied to multiple stages of sepsis, such as early prediction, prognosis assessment, mortality prediction, and optimal management. This review describes the latest literature on AI for clinical decision support in sepsis, and outlines the application of AI in the prediction, diagnosis, subphenotyping, prognosis assessment, and clinical management of sepsis. In addition, we discussed the challenges of implementing and accepting this non-traditional methodology for clinical purposes.

AB  - Parkinson's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder that is associated with aging, leading to the progressive deterioration of certain regions of the brain. Accurate and timely diagnosis plays a crucial role in facilitating optimal therapy and improving patient outcomes. This study presents an innovative approach to identify Parkinson's disease (PD) through the examination of audio waves using Feature Based - Deep Neural Network (FB-DNN) techniques. Autoencoder, a specific form of Artificial Neural Network (ANN) that is designed to excel in the task of feature extraction, is utilized in our study to effectively capture complex patterns present in audio data. Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are utilized in the task of classification, using the capabilities of deep learning (DL) to differentiate between audio samples that exhibit Parkinson's disease (PD) and those that do not. The deep neural network (DNN) model is trained using the retrieved data, allowing it to effectively distinguish minor variations in voice characteristics that are linked to Parkinson's disease. The suggested methodology not only enhances the precision of diagnosis but also enables prompt identification, perhaps resulting in more efficacious treatment methodologies. The present study introduces a potentially effective approach for the automated and non-intrusive identification of Parkinson's disease through the analysis of audio data. The integration of Autoencoder-based feature extraction with Deep Neural Networks (DNN) presents a dependable and easily accessible solution for the early detection and continuous monitoring of Parkinson's disease. This approach has promise for significantly improving the quality of life for persons affected by this condition. The implementation in Python was conducted as part of our experimentation. Upon analyzing the accuracy, it became apparent that the Feature-Based Deep Neural Network (FB-DNN) exhibited superior performance compared to the other models. Notably, the FB-DNN achieved the highest accuracy score of 96.15%.

AB  - We developed a novel machine learning (ML) algorithm with the goal of producing transparent models (i.e., understandable by humans) while also flexibly accounting for nonlinearity and interactions. Our method is based on ranked sparsity, and it allows for flexibility and user control in varying the shade of the opacity of black box machine learning methods. The main tenet of ranked sparsity is that an algorithm should be more skeptical of higher-order polynomials and interactions a priori compared to main effects, and hence, the inclusion of these more complex terms should require a higher level of evidence. In this work, we put our new ranked sparsity algorithm (as implemented in the open source R package, sparseR) to the test in a predictive model "bakeoff" (i.e., a benchmarking study of ML algorithms applied "out of the box", that is, with no special tuning). Algorithms were trained on a large set of simulated and real-world data sets from the Penn Machine Learning Benchmarks database, addressing both regression and binary classification problems. We evaluated the extent to which our human-centered algorithm can attain predictive accuracy that rivals popular black box approaches such as neural networks, random forests, and support vector machines, while also producing more interpretable models. Using out-of-bag error as a meta-outcome, we describe the properties of data sets in which human-centered approaches can perform as well as or better than black box approaches. We found that interpretable approaches predicted optimally or within 5% of the optimal method in most real-world data sets. We provide a more in-depth comparison of the performances of random forests to interpretable methods for several case studies, including exemplars in which algorithms performed similarly, and several cases when interpretable methods underperformed. This work provides a strong rationale for including human-centered transparent algorithms such as ours in predictive modeling applications.

AB  - While political commitments for building exascale systems have been made, turning these systems into platforms for a wide range of exascale applications faces several technical, organisational and skills-related challenges. The key technical challenges are related to the availability of data. While the first exascale machines are likely to be built within a single site, the input data is in many cases impossible to store within a single site. Alongside handling of extreme-large amount of data, the exascale system has to process data from different sources, support accelerated computing, handle high volume of requests per day, minimize the size of data flows, and be extensible in terms of continuously increasing data as well as an increase in parallel requests being sent. These technical challenges are addressed by the general reference exascale architecture. It is divided into three main blocks: virtualization layer, distributed virtual file system, and manager of computing resources. Its main property is modularity which is achieved by containerization at two levels: 1) application containers - containerization of scientific workflows, 2) micro-infrastructure - containerization of extreme-large data service-oriented infrastructure. The paper also presents an instantiation of the reference architecture - the architecture of the PROCESS project (PROviding Computing solutions for ExaScale ChallengeS) and discusses its relation to the reference exascale architecture. The PROCESS architecture has been used as an exascale platform within various exascale pilot applications. This paper also presents performance modelling of exascale platform with its validation.

AB  - Legacy and novel network services are expected to be migrated and designed to be deployed in fully virtualized environments. Starting with 5G, NFV becomes a formally required brick in the specifications, for services integrated within the infrastructure provider networks. This evolution leads to deployment of virtual resources Virtual-Machine (VM)-based, container-based and/or server-less platforms, all calling for a deep virtualization of infrastructure components. Such a network softwarization also unleashes further logical network virtualization, easing multi-layered, multi-actor and multi-access services, so as to be able to fulfill high availability, security, privacy and resilience requirements. However, the derived increased components heterogeneity makes the detection and the characterization of anomalies difficult, hence the relationship between anomaly detection and corresponding reconfiguration of the NFV stack to mitigate anomalies. In this article we propose an unsupervised machine-learning data-driven approach based on Long-Short- Term-Memory (LSTM) autoencoders to detect and characterize anomalies in virtualized networking services. With a radiography visualization, this approach can spot and describe deviations from nominal parameter values of any virtualized network service by means of a lightweight and iterative mean-squared reconstruction error analysis of LSTM-based autoencoders. We implement and validate the proposed methodology through experimental tests on a vIMS proof-of-concept deployed using Kubernetes.

AB  - tifies the anomalous source(s) after an anomaly is detected. It exploits the cyber-physical correlation or causality between the internal data of the SA system to narrow down the origin of anomaly while assuming no data can be entirely trusted. From the received information perspective, we propose EDRoad, an easy-to-use system for verification of the data received from external sources to ensure no compromised data will be used to provide services to the SA systems. Finally, from the control decision perspective, we introduce CADCA, a system for detecting and resolving control actions that may potentially lead to unstable system states or safety-critical situations.

AB  - <jats:p>The term NeuralODE describes the structural combination of an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and a numerical solver for Ordinary Differential Equations (ODE), the former acts as the right-hand side of the ODE to be solved. This concept was further extended by a black-box model in the form of a Functional Mock-up Unit (FMU) to obtain a subclass of NeuralODEs, named NeuralFMUs. The resulting structure features the advantages of the first-principle and data-driven modeling approaches in one single simulation model: a higher prediction accuracy compared to conventional First-Principle Models (FPMs) and also a lower training effort compared to purely data-driven models. We present an intuitive workflow to set up and use NeuralFMUs, enabling the encapsulation and reuse of existing conventional models exported from common modeling tools. Moreover, we exemplify this concept by deploying a NeuralFMU for a consumption simulation based on a Vehicle Longitudinal Dynamics Model (VLDM), which is a typical use case in the automotive industry. Related challenges that are often neglected in scientific use cases, such as real measurements (e.g., noise), an unknown system state or high-frequency discontinuities, are handled in this contribution. To build a hybrid model with a higher prediction quality than the original FPM, we briefly highlight two open-source libraries: FMI.jl, which allows for the import of FMUs into the Julia programming language, as well as the library FMIFlux.jl, which enables the integration of FMUs into neural network topologies to obtain a NeuralFMU.</jats:p>

AB  - <jats:p>In this thesis a method for segmenting textured images using Gabor filters is presented. One of the most recent approaches for texture segmentation and analysis is multi-channel filtering. There are several applicable choices as filter banks which are used for textured images. Gaussian filters modulated by exponential or by sinusoidal filters, known as Gabor filters, have been proven to be very usefyl for texture analysis for the images containing specific frequency and orientation characteristics.     Resembling the human visual cortical cells, Gabor function is a popular sub-band filter for multi-channel decompositon. Optimum joint spatial/spatial frequency uncertainty principle and its ability to recognize and pass specific frequencies and orientations are attributes of Gabor filter that make it more attractive. Gabor function with these attributes could simulate the task of simple visual cells in the cortex. Gabor function has several parameters that determine the sub-band Gabor filter and must be determined accurately to extract the features precisely for texture discrimination. A wide selection range for each parameter exists and many combinations of these parameters are possible. Accurate selection and combination of values for the parameters are of crucial importance. Hence a difficult goal is minimizing the number of filters.     On the other hand a variety of approaches of texture analysis and recognition have been presented in remote sensing applications, including land cover/land use classification and urban scene segmentation. With the avaiability of very high-resolution commercial satellite imagery such as IKONOS, it is possible to obtain detailed information on urban land use and change detection that are of particular interest to urban and regional planners.     In this thesis considering the attributes of human visual system, a hybrid algorithm is implemented using multi-channel decomposition by Gabor filter bank for feature extraction in conjunction with Artificial Neural Networks for both feature reduction and texture segmentation. Three approaches are implemented to optimize Gabor filter bank for image segmentation. Eventually the proposed method is successfully applied for segmentation of IKONOS satellite images.</jats:p>

AB  - <jats:p>OpenStreetMap (OSM) is the world’s largest peer-produced geospatial project. As a freely-editable open map of the world to which anyone may contribute or make use of, the dynamics and motivations of its contributors have been the object of significant scholarship. A growing phenomena in the OSM community is the increasing contributions of paid editing teams hired by tech corporations, such as, Microsoft, Apple, and Facebook. Though corporations have long supported OSM in various ways, the recent growth of teams of paid editors raises challenges to the community’s norms and policies, which are historically oriented around contributions by individual volunteer, making it hard to track the contribution of paid editors. This research addresses a fundamental problem in approaching these concerns: understanding the scale and character of corporate editing in OSM. We use machine-learning to improve upon prior approaches to estimating this phenomena, contributing both a novel methodology as well a more robust understanding of the latest corporate editing behavior in OSM.</jats:p>

AB  - <AbstractText Label="INTRODUCTION" NlmCategory="BACKGROUND">Necrotising enterocolitis (NEC) of the intestine of preterm infants leads to the risk of abdominal surgery, short bowel syndrome, neurodevelopmental disorders and death. Although the risks of NEC and its complications have been recognised in many countries, few countries have established NEC-specific registries to continuously monitor its aetiology and prognosis. In China, the understanding of risk factors and prognosis of NEC is incomplete, characterised by a lack of evidence from prospective and multicentre studies. Therefore, we designed a multicentre, prospective, open observational cohort study with the aim of investigating the risk factors and prognosis of NEC in a real-world setting in Shenzhen, Guangdong Province, by constructing an online registry of children with NEC and a bank of biospecimens.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="METHODS" NlmCategory="METHODS">This is a prospective, multicentre, open observational cohort study. From June 2024 to June 2028, more than 600 patients with NEC from 15 tertiary hospitals in Shenzhen, Guangdong Province, will be enrolled in the study. By constructing an online registry for NEC, clinical data will be collected during the prenatal and hospitalisation periods. Prospectively, biospecimens will be collected during the period of suspected NEC, at the time of confirmed NEC, and at the time of confirmed severe NEC, and filed in the online registry system. Follow-up data will include postdischarge healthcare needs, growth patterns measures, eye or vision examinations, cranial MRI findings, brainstem auditory evoked potentials or automated auditory brainstem responses, and the Chinese Griffith Developmental Scale at corrected age 18-24 months. Follow-up results were likewise recorded in an online registry system. Hospitalisation outcomes, including severe NEC, somatic growth and survival status, will be collected at discharge. Follow-up outcomes will include loss to visit, survival status, somatic growth measures and severe neurodevelopmental deficits at corrected age 18-24 months. This study will enhance our overall understanding of the risk factors and outcomes of NEC, ultimately helping to reduce the incidence of neonatal NEC and its poor prognosis.</AbstractText>

An improved XGBoost algorithm <jats:italic>via</jats:italic> Bayesian hyperparameter optimization (BH-XGBoost method) was proposed in this article, which is employed to forecast the short-term wind power for wind farms. Compared to the XGBoost, SVM, KELM, and LSTM, the results indicate that BH-XGBoost outperforms other methods in all the cases. The BH-XGBoost method could yield a more minor estimated error than the other methods, especially in the cases of wind ramp events caused by extreme weather conditions and low wind speed range. The comparison results led to the recommendation that the BH-XGBoost method is an effective method to forecast the short-term wind power for wind farms.</jats:p>

AB  - Known as the "fifth RNA nucleotide", pseudouridine (Ψ or psi) is the first-discovered and most abundant RNA modification occurring at the Uridine site, and it plays a prominent role in a number of biological processes. Thousands of Ψ sites have been identified within different biological contexts thanks to the advancement in high-throughput sequencing technology; nevertheless, the transcriptome-wide distribution, biomolecular functions, regulatory mechanisms, and disease relevance of pseudouridylation are largely elusive. We report here a web server-PIANO-for pseudouridine site (Ψ) identification and functional annotation. PIANO was built upon a high-accuracy predictor that takes advantage of both conventional sequence features and 42 additional genomic features. When tested on six independent datasets generated from four independent Ψ-profiling technologies (Ψ-seq, RBS-seq, Pseudo-seq, and CeU-seq) as benchmarks, PIANO achieved an average AUC of 0.955 and 0.838 under the full transcript and mature mRNA models, respectively, marking a substantial improvement in accuracy compared to the existing in silico Ψ-site prediction methods, i.e., PPUS (0.713 and 0.707), iRNA-PseU (0.713 and 0.712), and PseUI (0.634 and 0.652). Besides, PIANO web server systematically annotates the predicted Ψ sites with post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms (miRNA-targets, RBP-binding regions, and splicing sites) in its prediction report to help the users explore potential machinery of Ψ. Moreover, a concise query interface was also built for 4,303 known Ψ sites, which is currently the largest collection of experimentally validated human Ψ sites.

AB  - Crop protection is a key activity for the sustainability and feasibility of agriculture in a current context of climate change, which is causing the destabilization of agricultural practices and an increase in the incidence of current or invasive pests, and a growing world population that requires guaranteeing the food supply chain and ensuring food security. In view of these events, this article provides a contextual review in six sections on the role of artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML) and other emerging technologies to solve current and future challenges of crop protection. Over time, crop protection has progressed from a primitive agriculture 1.0 (Ag1.0) through various technological developments to reach a level of maturity closelyin line with Ag5.0 (section 1), which is characterized by successfully leveraging ML capacity and modern agricultural devices and machines that perceive, analyze and actuate following the main stages of precision crop protection (section 2). Section 3 presents a taxonomy of ML algorithms that support the development and implementation of precision crop protection, while section 4 analyses the scientific impact of ML on the basis of an extensive bibliometric study of >120 algorithms, outlining the most widely used ML and deep learning (DL) techniques currently applied in relevant case studies on the detection and control of crop diseases, weeds and plagues. Section 5 describes 39 emerging technologies in the fields of smart sensors and other advanced hardware devices, telecommunications, proximal and remote sensing, and AI-based robotics that will foreseeably lead the next generation of perception-based, decision-making and actuation systems for digitized, smart and real-time crop protection in a realistic Ag5.0. Finally, section 6 highlights the main conclusions and final remarks.

AB  - <p>As cities keep growing worldwide, so does the demand for key resources such as energy (electricity and gas) and water that residents consume. Meeting the demand for these resources can be challenging and requires an understanding of their consumptions patterns. In this work, we apply XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting) to predict and analyze water and energy consumption in large-scale buildings in New York City. For this, the New York City’s local law 84 extensive dataset was merged with the Primary Land Use Tax Lot Output (PLUTO) dataset as well as with other socio-economic databases. Specifically, we developed three models: electricity, gas, and water consumption. Seven major lessons were learnt in terms of interrelationships between electricity, gas, and water consumption. In particular, water and gas consumption are highly interrelated with one another (often because gas is used for water heating). Furthermore, electricity consumption is affected by building type, and electricity and water consumption are particularly interrelated in nonresidential buildings. Overall, the knowledge gained from the models and from the SHAP analysis can help planners, engineers, and policymakers develop more effective strategies and help them manage the demand for energy and water in large-scale buildings.</p>

AB  - To protect the environment and achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), reducing greenhouse gas emissions has been actively promoted by global governments. Thus, clean energy, such as wind power, has become a very important topic among global governments. However, accurately forecasting wind power output is not a straightforward task. The present study attempts to develop a fuzzy seasonal long short-term memory network (FSLSTM) that includes the fuzzy decomposition method and long short-term memory network (LSTM) to forecast a monthly wind power output dataset. LSTM technology has been successfully applied to forecasting problems, especially time series problems. This study first adopts the fuzzy seasonal index into the fuzzy LSTM model, which effectively extends the traditional LSTM technology. The FSLSTM, LSTM, autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA), generalized regression neural network (GRNN), back propagation neural network (BPNN), least square support vector regression (LSSVR), and seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) models are then used to forecast monthly wind power output datasets in Taiwan. The empirical results indicate that FSLSTM can obtain better performance in terms of forecasting accuracy than the other methods. Therefore, FSLSTM can efficiently provide credible prediction values for Taiwan’s wind power output datasets.

AB  - <jats:p>In the recent years, the scale of online transaction has increased considerably. Subsequently, this has also increased the number of fraud cases, causing billions of dollars losses each year worldwide. Therefore, it has become mandatory to implement mechanisms that are able to assist in fraud detection. In this work, the use of Ensemble Genetic Algorithm is proposed to identify frauds in electronic transactions, more specifically in online credit card operations. A case study, using the dataset containing transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders, is used. This dataset presents transactions that occurred in two days, where we have 492 frauds out of 284,807 transactions. The presented algorithm achieves good performance in fraud detection as compared to the other machine learning algorithms. The results show that the proposed algorithm achieved good classification effectiveness in all tested instances.</jats:p>

AB  - <AbstractText Label="OBJECTIVE" NlmCategory="OBJECTIVE">The goals of this article are as follows. First, to investigate the possibility of detecting autism spectrum disorder (ASD) from text data using the latest generation of machine learning tools. Second, to compare model performance on two datasets of transcribed statements, collected using two different diagnostic tools. Third, to investigate the feasibility of knowledge transfer between models trained on both datasets and check if data augmentation can help alleviate the problem of a small number of observations.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="METHOD" NlmCategory="METHODS">We explore two techniques to detect ASD. The first one is based on fine-tuning HerBERT, a BERT-based, monolingual deep transformer neural network. The second one uses the newest, multipurpose text embeddings from OpenAI and a classifier. We apply the methods to two separate datasets of transcribed statements, collected using two different diagnostic tools: thought, language, and communication (TLC) and autism diagnosis observation schedule-2 (ADOS-2). We conducted several cross-dataset experiments in both a zero-shot setting and a setting where models are pretrained on one dataset and then training continues on another to test the possibility of knowledge transfer.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="RESULTS">Unlike previous studies, the models we tested obtained average results on ADOS-2 data but reached very good performance of the models in TLC. We did not observe any benefits from knowledge transfer between datasets. We observed relatively poor performance of models trained on augmented data and hypothesize that data augmentation by back translation obfuscates autism-specific signals.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="CONCLUSION" NlmCategory="CONCLUSIONS">The quality of machine learning models that detect ASD from text data is improving, but model results are dependent on the type of input data or diagnostic tool.</AbstractText>

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has posed notable challenges to post-secondary students, causing concern for their psychological well-being. In the face of school closures, academic disruptions, and constraints on social gatherings, it is crucial to understand the extent to which mental health among post-secondary students has been impacted in order to inform support implementation for this population. The present meta-analysis examines the global prevalence of clinically significant depression and anxiety among post-secondary students during the COVID-19 pandemic. Several moderator analyses were also performed to examine sources of variability in depression and anxiety prevalence rates. A systematic search was conducted across six databases on May 3, 2021, yielding a total of 176 studies (1,732,456 participants) which met inclusion criteria. Random-effects meta-analyses of 126 studies assessing depression symptoms and 144 studies assessing anxiety symptoms were conducted. The pooled prevalence estimates of clinically elevated depressive and anxiety symptoms for post-secondary students during the COVID-19 pandemic was 30.6% (95% CI: 0.274, 0.340) and 28.2% (CI: 0.246, 0.321), respectively. The month of data collection and geographical region were determined to be significant moderators. However, student age, sex, type (i.e., healthcare student vs. non-healthcare student), and level of training (i.e., undergraduate, university or college generally; graduate, medical, post-doctorate, fellow, trainee), were not sources of variability in pooled rates of depression and anxiety symptoms during the pandemic. The current study indicates a call for continued access to mental health services to ensure post-secondary students receive adequate support during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. <b>Systematic Review Registration:</b> PROSPERO website: https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/, identifier: CRD42021253547.

AB  - Anomaly detection is the main topic in artificial intelligence and a crucial factor in productivity. The anomaly detection model based on generative models is a prime approach in this field, such as AnoGAN, CBiGAN. However, most of the current anomaly detection models with generative models are not accurate enough to reconstruct images. These cause differences between the detection image and reconstruction image even in normal regions of the detection image, which seriously affects the detection accuracy. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a new method for anomaly detection called ACGan. It uses CBiGAN as the generative model and adds an attention network based on the U-Net structure to find anomalous regions in images. The method can avoid errors caused by the lack of accuracy in reconstructing images by focusing the model's attention on anomalous regions. In this paper, three training methods, unsupervised learning, supervised learning and supervised learning with noise data, are designed. Experiments on the realistic dataset MVTec AD validated the effectiveness of the model. For unsupervised learning, the model has higher accuracy than CBiGAN on most product images. The models trained by supervised learning with noise data are highly robust. And the model has super high accuracy and is adequate for practical industrial needs if supervised learning is used.

However, the relationship between the structural covariance network, a measure of brain connectivity, and smoking severity remains unclear. To fill this gap, this study aimed to investigate the relationship between structural covariance network and smoking severity in smokers.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="Methods" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">A total of 101 male smokers and 51 male non-smokers were recruited, and they underwent a T1-weighted anatomical image scan. First, an individualized structural covariance network was derived via a jackknife-bias estimation procedure for each participant. Then, a data-driven machine learning method called connectome-based predictive modeling (CPM) was conducted to infer smoking severity measured with Fagerström Test for Nicotine Dependence (FTND) scores using an individualized structural covariance network. The performance of CPM was evaluated using the leave-one-out cross-validation and a permutation testing.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="Results" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">As a result, CPM identified the smoking severity-related structural covariance network, as indicated by a significant correlation between predicted and actual FTND scores (r = 0.23, permutation <i>p</i> = 0.020).

AB  - <jats:p>Machine-learning algorithms have long aided in geologic property prediction from well-log data, but are primarily used to classify lithology, facies, formation, and rock types. However, more detailed properties (e.g., porosity, grain size) that are important for evaluating hydrocarbon exploration and development activities, as well as subsurface geothermal, CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> sequestration, and hydrological studies have not been a focus of machine-learning predictions. This study focuses on improving machine-learning regression-based workflows for quantitative geological property prediction (porosity, grain size, XRF geochemistry), using a robust dataset from the Dad Sandstone Member of the Lewis Shale in the Green River Basin, Wyoming.</jats:p> <jats:p>Twelve slabbed cores collected from wells targeting turbiditic sandstones and mudstones of the Dad Sandstone member provide 1212.2 ft. of well-log and core data to test the efficacy of five machine-learning models, ranging in complexity from multivariate linear regression to deep neural networks. Our results demonstrate that gradient-boosted decision-tree models (<jats:italic>e.g.</jats:italic>, CatBoost, XGBoost) are flexible in terms of input data completeness, do not require scaled data, and are reliably accurate, with the lowest or second lowest root mean squared error (RMSE) for every test. Deep neural networks, while used commonly for these applications, never achieved lowest error for any of the testing. We also utilize newly collected XRF geochemistry and grain-size data to constrain spatiotemporal sediment routing, sand-mud partitioning, and paleo-oceanographic redox conditions in the Green River Basin.</jats:p> <jats:p>Test-train dataset splitting traditionally uses randomized inter-well data, but a blind well testing strategy is more applicable to most geoscience applications that aim to predict properties of new, unseen well locations. We find that using inter-well training datasets are more optimistic when applied to blind wells, with a median difference of 0.58 RMSE when predicting grain size in phi units. Using these data and results, we establish a baseline workflow for applying machine-learning regression algorithms to core-based reservoir properties from well-log and core-image data. We hope that our findings and open-source code and datasets released with this paper will serve as a baseline for further research to improve geological property prediction for sustainable earth-resource modeling.</jats:p>

          <jats:p>The continued success of the jet substructure program will require widespread use of tracking information to enable increasingly precise measurements of a broader class of observables. The recent reformulation of jet substructure in terms of energy correlators has simplified the incorporation of universal non-perturbative matrix elements, so called “track functions”, in jet substructure calculations. These advances make it timely to understand how these universal non-perturbative functions can be extracted from hadron collider data, which is complicated by the use jet algorithms. In this paper we introduce a new class of jet functions, which we call (semi-inclusive) track jet functions, which describe measurements of the track energy fraction in identified jets. These track jet functions can be matched onto the universal track functions, with perturbatively calculable matching coefficients that incorporate the jet algorithm dependence. We perform this matching, and present phenomenological results for the charged energy fraction in jets at the LHC and EIC/HERA at collinear next-to-leading logarithmic accuracy. We show that higher moments of the charged energy fraction directly exhibit non-linear Lorentzian renormalization group flows, allowing the study of these flows with collider data. Our factorization theorem enables the extraction of universal track functions from jet measurements, opening the door to their use for a precision jet substructure program.</jats:p>

AB  - What factors constrain the arrangement of the multiple fields of a place cell? By modeling place cells as perceptrons that act on multiscale periodic grid-cell inputs, we analytically enumerate a place cell's repertoire - how many field arrangements it can realize without external cues while its grid inputs are unique - and derive its capacity - the spatial range over which it can achieve any field arrangement. We show that the repertoire is very large and relatively noise-robust. However, the repertoire is a vanishing fraction of all arrangements, while capacity scales only as the sum of the grid periods so field arrangements are constrained over larger distances. Thus, grid-driven place field arrangements define a large response scaffold that is strongly constrained by its structured inputs. Finally, we show that altering grid-place weights to generate an arbitrary new place field strongly affects existing arrangements, which could explain the volatility of the place code.

AB  - Utilizing machine learning calculations, this study plans to foresee ongoing kidney illness.A condition wherein the kidneys cannot dispose of poisons from the body is known as persistent kidney sickness.It is conceivably the deadliest disorder, and a wrong finding can achieve mortality.Chronic kidney disease (CKD) influences around 800 individuals for every million individuals (pmp), while end-stage renal disease (ESRD) influences 150-200 individuals for every million individuals (pmp).In India, 18,000 to 20,000 patients (or 10% of new ESRD cases) use dialysis.A hemodialysis treatment costs between $15 and $40, and erythropoietin adds $150 to $200 per month.The patient may not exhibit any symptoms during the disease's early stages that would prevent it from becoming chronic.Several data mining and machine learning algorithms can aid the diagnosis of CKD.This study's dataset was obtained from the UCI repository.Expectation strategies included the K-Nearest Neighbor method, Random Forest, Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine, Gradient Boosting, XG boost, Ada boost, and Ensemble.The characteristics of prediction and their correlation were examined from a medical perspective.

AB  - Human Body constitution ( prakriti ) defines what is in harmony with human nature and what will cause to move out of balance and experience illness. Tridosha defines the three basic energies or principles that determine the function of our body on the physical and emotional levels. The three energies are known as VATT , PITT and KAPH . Each individual has a unique balance of all three of these energies. Some people will be predominant in one, while others will be a mixture of two or more. Ayurveda-dosha studies have been used for a long time, but the quantitative reliability measurement of these diagnostic methods still lags behind. A careful and appropriate analysis leads to an effective treatment. To collect a meaningful data set, a questionnaire with 28 different characteristics is validated by Ayurveda experts. Authors calculate Cronbach alpha of VATT-Dosha , PITT-Dosha and KAPH-Dosha as 0.94, 0.98 and 0.98, respectively to check the reliability of the questionnaire. Authors analyzed questionnaires of 807 healthy persons aged 20-60 years and found 62.1% men and 37.9% women. The class imbalance problem is resolved with oversampling and the equally distributed data set of randomly selected 405 persons is used for the actual experiment. Using computer algorithms, we randomly divide the data set (8:2) into a training set of 324 persons and a test data set of 81 persons. Model is trained using traditional machine learning techniques for classification analysis as Artificial Neural Network (ANN), K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Naive Bayes (NB) and Decision Tree (DT). System is also implemented using ensemble of several machine learning methods for constitution recognition. Evaluation measures of classification such as root mean square error (RMSE), precision, recall, F-score, and accuracy is calculated and analyzed. On analyzing the results authors find that the data is best trained and tested with CatBoost, which is tuned with hyper parameters and achieves 0.96 precision, 0.95 recall, 0.95 F-score and 0.95 accuracy rate. The experimental result shows that the proposed model based on ensemble learning methods clearly surpasses conventional methods. The results conclude that advances in boosting algorithms could give machine learning a leading future.

AB  - <jats:p>Coffee is the most burned-through handled drink beside water, which is said to be the most exchanged cultivating product followed by oil in the entire globe. The two most significant sorts of coffee assortment filled in India are Arabica and Robusta out of 103 assortments of class coffee bean variety, which are economically exchanged around the planet. In this regard, we are taking major plantation crop in India i.e., Coffee for our research to explore and develop a predictive model for the development of coffee planters to take precise decisions in time during adverse situations in advance. Hence we propose a framework for coffee yield prediction which using machine learning ensemble approach to estimate the influence of agronomic factors to get a good coffee yield. Here, for our research work, the historic dataset is considered which is obtained from Central Coffee Research Institute (CCRI), Karnataka for the year (2008-2019). For the coffee yield prediction, we are considering agronomic factors like Age, Soil Nutrients: Organic carbon (OC), Phosphorus (P), Potassium (K), Alkaline (pH), Zone and Respective yield obtained in chikkamagaluru   region, Karnataka state, India. Different classifiers are used namely, Extra Tree Classifier, Random Forest Classifier, Decision Tree and Boosting Algorithms for prediction and performance of each is compared and analyzed. Our results shown that Extra Tree Classifier and Random forest (RF) classifier with a precision of 91% with good results based on performance metrics considered respectively is an effective and versatile machine-learning method compared to other algorithms used.</jats:p>

AB  - People usually spend several hours per day inside buildings, and they require great amounts of energy and resources to operate. Although there are numerous studies about smart buildings, there is still a need for new intelligent techniques for efficient smart building management. This paper proposes the use of Wi-Fi network association information as a basis for the design of intelligent systems for smart buildings. We propose a unified experimental methodology to evaluate machine learning (ML) models on their capacity to accurately predict Wi-Fi access point demand for energy-efficient smart buildings. The evaluation involves the use of multiple classification and regression models using a variety of configurations and algorithms. We conducted an experimental analysis using our proposed methodology to determine which ML models provide the best performance results using data collected from a large scale Wi-Fi network located at Fluminense Federal University (UFF) over a period of 6 months. The proposed methodology enables the user to evaluate and to create ML models for energy efficient smart building management systems. We achieved 86.69% accuracy for occupancy prediction using classification techniques and RMSPE (Root Mean Squared Percentage Error) of 0.29 for occupancy count prediction using regression techniques.

AB  - <jats:p>Short-term traffic flow prediction is to automatically predict the traffic flow changes in a period of future time based on the extraction of the spatiotemporal features in the road network. For governments, timely and accurate traffic flow prediction is crucial to plan road manage-ment and improve traffic efficiency. Recent advances in deep learning have shown their dominance on short-term traffic flow prediction. However, previous methods based on deep learning are mainly limited to temporal features and have so far failed to predict the bidirectional con-textual spatiotemporal relationship correctly. Besides, the precision and the practicality are limited by the road network scale and the single time scale. To remedy these issues, a Bidirectional Context-aware and Multi-scale fusion hybrid Network (BCM-Net) is proposed, which is a novel short-term traffic flow prediction framework to predict timely and accurate traffic flow changes. In BCM-Net, the Bidirectional Context-aware (BCM) block is added to the feature extraction structure to effective-ly integrate spatiotemporal features. The Interpolation Back Propagation sub-network is used to merge multi-scale information, which further improves the robustness of the model. Experiment results on diverse datasets demonstrated that the proposed method outperformed the state-of-the-art methods.</jats:p>

AB  - Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a life-threatening lung disease and a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Although a curative therapy has yet to be found, permanent monitoring of biomarkers that reflect the disease progression plays a pivotal role for the effective management of COPD. The accurate examination of respiratory tract fluids like saliva is a promising approach for staging disease and predicting its upcoming exacerbations in a Point-of-Care (PoC) environment. However, the concurrent consideration of patients' demographic and medical parameters is necessary for achieving accurate outcomes. Therefore, Machine Learning (ML) tools can play an important role for analyzing patient data and providing comprehensive results for the recognition of COPD in a PoC setting. As a result, the objective of this research work was to implement ML tools on data acquired from characterizing saliva samples of COPD patients and healthy controls as well as their demographic information for PoC recognition of the disease. For this purpose, a permittivity biosensor was used to characterize dielectric properties of saliva samples and, subsequently, ML tools were applied on the acquired data for classification. The XGBoost gradient boosting algorithm provided a high classification accuracy and sensitivity of 91.25% and 100%, respectively, making it a promising model for COPD evaluation. Integration of this model on a neuromorphic chip, in the future, will enable the real-time assessment of COPD in PoC, with low cost, low energy consumption, and high patient privacy. In addition, constant monitoring of COPD in a near-patient setup will enable the better management of the disease exacerbations.

AB  - Robots that physically interact with their surroundings, in order to accomplish some tasks or assist humans in their activities, require to exploit contact forces in a safe and proficient manner. Impedance control is considered as a prominent approach in robotics to avoid large impact forces while operating in unstructured environments. In such environments, the conditions under which the interaction occurs may significantly vary during the task execution. This demands robots to be endowed with online adaptation capabilities to cope with sudden and unexpected changes in the environment. In this context, variable impedance control arises as a powerful tool to modulate the robot's behavior in response to variations in its surroundings. In this survey, we present the state-of-the-art of approaches devoted to variable impedance control from control and learning perspectives (separately and jointly). Moreover, we propose a new taxonomy for mechanical impedance based on variability, learning, and control. The objective of this survey is to put together the concepts and efforts that have been done so far in this field, and to describe advantages and disadvantages of each approach. The survey concludes with open issues in the field and an envisioned framework that may potentially solve them.

AB  - In this article, we present a comprehensive study with an experimental analysis of federated deep learning approaches for cyber security in the Internet of Things (IoT) applications. Specifically, we first provide a review of the federated learning-based security and privacy systems for several types of IoT applications, including, Industrial IoT, Edge Computing, Internet of Drones, Internet of Healthcare Things, Internet of Vehicles, etc. Second, the use of federated learning with blockchain and malware/intrusion detection systems for IoT applications is discussed. Then, we review the vulnerabilities in federated learning-based security and privacy systems. Finally, we provide an experimental analysis of federated deep learning with three deep learning approaches, namely, Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and Deep Neural Network (DNN). For each deep learning model, we study the performance of centralized and federated learning under three new real IoT traffic datasets, namely, the Bot-IoT dataset, the MQTTset dataset, and the TON_IoT dataset. The goal of this article is to provide important information on federated deep learning approaches with emerging technologies for cyber security. In addition, it demonstrates that federated deep learning approaches outperform the classic/centralized versions of machine learning (non-federated learning) in assuring the privacy of IoT device data and provide the higher accuracy in detecting attacks.

AB  - MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small endogenous RNAs that play important regulatory roles in plants by negatively affecting gene expression. Studies on the identification of miRNAs and their functions in various plant species and organs have significantly contributed to plant development research. In the current study, we utilized high-throughput sequencing to detect the miRNAs in the root, stem, and leaf tissues of raspberry (Rubus idaeus). A total of more than 35 million small RNA reads ranging in size from 18 to 35 nucleotides were obtained, with 147 known miRNAs and 542 novel miRNAs identified among the three organs. Sequence verification and the relative expression profiles of the six known miRNAs were investigated by stem-loop quantitative real-time PCR. Furthermore, the potential target genes of the known and novel miRNAs were predicted and subjected to Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway annotation. Enrichment analysis of the GO-associated biological processes and molecular functions revealed that these target genes were potentially involved in a wide range of metabolic pathways and developmental processes. Moreover, the miRNA target prediction revealed that most of the targets predicted as transcription factor-coding genes are involved in cellular and metabolic processes. This report is the first to identify miRNAs in raspberry. The detected miRNAs were analyzed by cluster analysis according to their expression, which revealed that these conservative miRNAs are necessary for plant functioning. The results add novel miRNAs to the raspberry transcriptome, providing a useful resource for the further elucidation of the functional roles of miRNAs in raspberry growth and development.

AB  - Prostate cancer is a major world health problem for men. This shows how important early detection and accurate diagnosis are for better treatment and patient outcomes. This study compares different ways to find Prostate Cancer (PCa) and label tumors as normal or abnormal, with the goal of speeding up current work in microarray gene data analysis. The study looks at how well several feature extraction methods work with three feature selection strategies: Harmonic Search (HS), Firefly Algorithm (FA), and Elephant Herding Optimization (EHO). The techniques tested are Expectation Maximization (EM), Nonlinear Regression (NLR), K-means, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT). Eight classifiers are used for the task of classification. These are Random Forest, Decision Tree, Adaboost, XGBoost, and Support Vector Machine (SVM) with linear, polynomial, and radial basis function kernels. This study looks at how well these classifiers work with and without feature selection methods. It finds that the SVM with radial basis function kernel, using DCT for feature extraction and EHO for feature selection, does the best of all of them, with an accuracy of 94.8 % and an error rate of 5.15 %.

AB  - Scientific data analyses often combine several computational tools in automated pipelines, or workflows. Thousands of such workflows have been used in the life sciences, though their composition has remained a cumbersome manual process due to a lack of standards for annotation, assembly, and implementation. Recent technological advances have returned the long-standing vision of automated workflow composition into focus. This article summarizes a recent Lorentz Center workshop dedicated to automated composition of workflows in the life sciences. We survey previous initiatives to automate the composition process, and discuss the current state of the art and future perspectives. We start by drawing the "big picture" of the scientific workflow development life cycle, before surveying and discussing current methods, technologies and practices for semantic domain modelling, automation in workflow development, and workflow assessment. Finally, we derive a roadmap of individual and community-based actions to work toward the vision of automated workflow development in the forthcoming years. A central outcome of the workshop is a general description of the workflow life cycle in six stages: 1) scientific question or hypothesis, 2) conceptual workflow, 3) abstract workflow, 4) concrete workflow, 5) production workflow, and 6) scientific results. The transitions between stages are facilitated by diverse tools and methods, usually incorporating domain knowledge in some form. Formal semantic domain modelling is hard and often a bottleneck for the application of semantic technologies. However, life science communities have made considerable progress here in recent years and are continuously improving, renewing interest in the application of semantic technologies for workflow exploration, composition and instantiation. Combined with systematic benchmarking with reference data and large-scale deployment of production-stage workflows, such technologies enable a more systematic process of workflow development than we know today. We believe that this can lead to more robust, reusable, and sustainable workflows in the future.

AB  - A challenging problem in both engineering and computer science is that of minimising a function for which we have no mathematical formulation available, that is expensive to evaluate, and that contains continuous and integer variables, for example in automatic algorithm configuration. Surrogate-based algorithms are very suitable for this type of problem, but most existing techniques are designed with only continuous or only discrete variables in mind. Mixed-Variable ReLU-based Surrogate Modelling (MVRSM) is a surrogate-based algorithm that uses a linear combination of rectified linear units, defined in such a way that (local) optima satisfy the integer constraints. Unlike other methods, it also has a constant run-time per iteration. This method outperforms the state of the art on several synthetic benchmarks with up to 238 continuous and integer variables, and achieves competitive performance on two real-life benchmarks: XG-Boost hyperparameter tuning and Electrostatic Precipitator optimisation.

AB  - <jats:p>Abstract. Agricultural nitrous oxide (N2O) emission accounts for a non-trivial
fraction of global greenhouse gas (GHG) budget. To date, estimating
N2O fluxes from cropland remains a challenging task because the related
microbial processes (e.g., nitrification and denitrification) are controlled
by complex interactions among climate, soil, plant and human activities.
Existing approaches such as process-based (PB) models have well-known
limitations due to insufficient representations of the processes or
uncertainties of model parameters, and due to leverage recent advances in
machine learning (ML) a new method is needed to unlock the “black box” to
overcome its limitations such as low interpretability, out-of-sample failure
and massive data demand. In this study, we developed a first-of-its-kind
knowledge-guided machine learning model for agroecosystems (KGML-ag) by
incorporating biogeophysical and chemical domain knowledge from an advanced PB
model, ecosys, and tested it by comparing simulating daily N2O fluxes with
real observed data from mesocosm experiments. The gated recurrent unit (GRU)
was used as the basis to build the model structure. To optimize the model
performance, we have investigated a range of ideas, including (1) using
initial values of intermediate variables (IMVs) instead of time series as
model input to reduce data demand; (2) building hierarchical structures to
explicitly estimate IMVs for further N2O prediction; (3) using multi-task
learning to balance the simultaneous training on multiple variables; and (4)
pre-training with millions of synthetic data generated from ecosys and fine-tuning
with mesocosm observations. Six other pure ML models were developed using
the same mesocosm data to serve as the benchmark for the KGML-ag model.
Results show that KGML-ag did an excellent job in reproducing the mesocosm
N2O fluxes (overall r2=0.81, and RMSE=3.6 mgNm-2d-1
from cross validation). Importantly, KGML-ag always outperforms
the PB model and ML models in predicting N2O fluxes, especially for
complex temporal dynamics and emission peaks. Besides, KGML-ag goes beyond
the pure ML models by providing more interpretable predictions as well as
pinpointing desired new knowledge and data to further empower the current
KGML-ag. We believe the KGML-ag development in this study will stimulate a
new body of research on interpretable ML for biogeochemistry and other
related geoscience processes.

AB  - <jats:p>Wisdom-of-Crowds-Bots (WoC-Bots) are simple, modular agents working together in a multi-agent environment to collectively make binary predictions. The agents represent a knowledge-diverse crowd, with each agent trained on a subset of available information. A honey-bee-derived swarm aggregation mechanism is used to elicit a collective prediction with an associated confidence value from the agents. Due to their multi-agent design, WoC-Bots can be distributed across multiple hardware nodes, include new features without re-training existing agents, and the aggregation mechanism can be used to incorporate predictions from other sources, thus improving overall predictive accuracy of the system. In addition to these advantages, we demonstrate that WoC-Bots are competitive with other top classification methods on three datasets and apply our system to a real-world sports betting problem, producing a consistent return on investment from 1 January 2021 through 15 November 2022 on most major sports.</jats:p>

AB  - With the rapid development of biotechnology, the number of biological sequences has grown exponentially. The continuous expansion of biological sequence data promotes the application of machine learning in biological sequences to construct predictive models for mining biological sequence information. There are many branches of biological sequence classification research. In this review, we mainly focus on the function and modification classification of biological sequences based on machine learning. Sequence-based prediction and analysis are the basic tasks to understand the biological functions of DNA, RNA, proteins, and peptides. However, there are hundreds of classification models developed for biological sequences, and the quite varied specific methods seem dizzying at first glance. Here, we aim to establish a long-term support website (http://lab.malab.cn/~acy/BioseqData/home.html), which provides readers with detailed information on the classification method and download links to relevant datasets. We briefly introduce the steps to build an effective model framework for biological sequence data. In addition, a brief introduction to single-cell sequencing data analysis methods and applications in biology is also included. Finally, we discuss the current challenges and future perspectives of biological sequence classification research.

AB  - The integration of renewable energy sources has resulted in an increasing intricacy in the functioning and organization of power systems. Accurate load forecasting, particularly taking into account dynamic factors like as climatic and socioeconomic impacts, is essential for effective management. Conventional statistical analysis and machine learning methods struggle with accurately capturing the intricate temporal relationships present in load data. Recurrent neural networks (RNNs), specifically long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, demonstrate potential in representing and interpreting sequences of data. This study presents an approach that employs an LSTM-RNN model for load forecast prediction. This study highlights the importance of this technology in combining effective demand response with distributed renewable energy sources, which are crucial for the stability of smart grids and accurate power demand estimation. The LSTM-RNN model has outstanding accuracy, with a Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 1.5% and a Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 26.5 for hourly forecasts. Additionally, it achieves a MAPE of 1.77% and an RMSE of 30 for yearly load estimations. The hourly LSTM-RNN load forecast model outperforms the yearly LSTM-RNN load forecast model, as evidenced by lower error rates. Importantly, this model demonstrates robustness even when the inputs are inadequate or noisy. To summarize, this research suggests that LSTM-RNN is a practical and efficient approach for precisely forecasting load in power systems. This underscores its capacity to enhance operational efficiency and resilience in power systems.

AB  - Balance and gait impairments, and consequently, mobility restrictions and falls are common in Parkinson's disease (PD). Various cognitive deficits are also common in PD and are associated with increased fall risk. These mobility and cognitive deficits are limiting factors in a person's health, ability to perform activities of daily living, and overall quality of life. Community ambulation involves many dual-task (DT) conditions that require processing of several cognitive tasks while managing or reacting to sudden or unexpected balance challenges. DT training programs that can simultaneously target balance, gait, visuomotor, and cognitive functions are important to consider in rehabilitation and promotion of healthy active lives. In the proposed multi-center, randomized controlled trial (RCT), novel behavioral positron emission tomography (PET) brain imaging methods are used to evaluate the molecular basis and neural underpinnings of: (a) the decline of mobility function in PD, specifically, balance, gait, visuomotor, and cognitive function, and (b) the effects of an engaging, game-based DT treadmill walking program on mobility and cognitive functions. Both the interactive cognitive game tasks and treadmill walking require continuous visual attention, and share spatial processing functions, notably to minimize any balance disturbance or gait deviation/stumble. The ability to "walk and talk" normally includes activation of specific regions of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and the basal ganglia (site of degeneration in PD). The PET imaging analysis and comparison with healthy age-matched controls will allow us to identify areas of abnormal, reduced activity levels, as well as areas of excessive activity (increased attentional resources) during DT-walking. We will then be able to identify areas of brain plasticity associated with improvements in mobility functions (balance, gait, and cognition) after intervention. We expect the gait-cognitive training effect to involve re-organization of PFC activity among other, yet to be identified brain regions. The DT mobility-training platform and behavioral PET brain imaging methods are directly applicable to other diseases that affect gait and cognition, e.g., cognitive vascular impairment, Alzheimer's disease, as well as in aging.

AB  - Crop yield has been predicted using environmental, land, water, and crop characteristics in a prospective research design. When it comes to predicting crop production, there are a number of factors to consider, including weather conditions, soil qualities, water levels and the location of the farm. A broad variety of algorithms based on deep learning are used to extract useful crops for forecasting. The combination of data mining and deep learning creates a whole crop yield prediction system that is able to connect raw data to predicted crop yields. The suggested study uses a Discrete Deep belief network with Visual Geometry Group (VGG) Net classification method over the tweak chick swarm optimization approach to estimate agricultural production. The Network’s successively stacked layers were fed the data parameters. Based on the input parameters, a crop production prediction environment is constructed using the network architecture. Using the tweak chick swarm optimization technique, the best characteristics of input data are preprocessed, and the optimal output is used as input for the classification process. Discrete Deep belief network with the Visual Geometry Group Net classifier is used to classify the data and forecast agricultural production. The suggested model correctly predicts crop output with 97 percent accuracy, exceeding existing models by maintaining the baseline data distribution.

AB  - Breast cancer is the most prevalent type of cancer in women. Risk factor assessment can aid in directing counseling regarding risk reduction and breast cancer surveillance. This research aims to (1) investigate the relationship between various risk factors and breast cancer incidence using the BCSC (Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium) Risk Factor Dataset and create a prediction model for assessing the risk of developing breast cancer; (2) diagnose breast cancer using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin diagnostic dataset; and (3) analyze breast cancer survivability using the SEER (Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results) Breast Cancer Dataset. Applying resampling techniques on the training dataset before using various machine learning techniques can affect the performance of the classifiers. The three breast cancer datasets were examined using a variety of pre-processing approaches and classification models to assess their performance in terms of accuracy, precision, F-1 scores, etc. The PCA (principal component analysis) and resampling strategies produced remarkable results. For the BCSC Dataset, the Random Forest algorithm exhibited the best performance out of the applied classifiers, with an accuracy of 87.53%. Out of the different resampling techniques applied to the training dataset for training the Random Forest classifier, the Tomek Link exhibited the best test accuracy, at 87.47%. We compared all the models used with previously used techniques. After applying the resampling techniques, the accuracy scores of the test data decreased even if the training data accuracy increased. For the Breast Cancer Wisconsin diagnostic dataset, the K-Nearest Neighbor algorithm had the best accuracy with the original dataset test set, at 94.71%, and the PCA dataset test set exhibited 95.29% accuracy for detecting breast cancer. Using the SEER Dataset, this study also explores survival analysis, employing supervised and unsupervised learning approaches to offer insights into the variables affecting breast cancer survivability. This study emphasizes the significance of individualized approaches in the management and treatment of breast cancer by incorporating phenotypic variations and recognizing the heterogeneity of the disease. Through data-driven insights and advanced machine learning, this study contributes significantly to the ongoing efforts in breast cancer research, diagnostics, and personalized medicine.

AB  - We show how acoustic prosodic features, such as pitch and gaps, can be used computationally for detecting symptoms of schizophrenia from a single spoken response. We compare the individual contributions of acoustic and previously-employed text modalities to the algorithmic determination whether the speaker has schizophrenia. Our classification results clearly show that we can extract relevant acoustic features better than those textual ones. We find that, when combined with those acoustic features, textual features improve classification only slightly.

AB  - <jats:p>Recent advances in Earth Observation (EO) placed Citizen Science (CS) in the highest position, declaring their essential provision of information in every discipline that serves the SDGs, and the 2050 climate neutrality targets. However, so far, none of the published literature reviews has investigated the models and tools that assimilate these data sources. Following this gap of knowledge, we synthesised this scoping systematic literature review (SSLR) with a will to cover this limitation and highlight the benefits and the future directions that remain uncovered. Adopting the SSLR guidelines, a double and two-level screening hybrid process found 66 articles to meet the eligibility criteria, presenting methods, where data were fused and evaluated regarding their performance, scalability level and computational efficiency. Subsequent reference is given on EO-data, their corresponding conversions, the citizens’ participation digital tools, and Data Fusion (DF) models that are predominately exploited. Preliminary results showcased a preference in the multispectral satellite sensors, with the microwave sensors to be used as a supplementary data source. Approaches such as the “brute-force approach” and the super-resolution models indicate an effective way to overcome the spatio-temporal gaps and the so far reliance on commercial satellite sensors. Passive crowdsensing observations are foreseen to gain a greater audience as, described in, most cases as a low-cost and easily applicable solution even in the unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic. Immersive platforms and decentralised systems should have a vital role in citizens’ engagement and training process. Reviewing the DF models, the majority of the selected articles followed a data-driven method with the traditional algorithms to still hold significant attention. An exception is revealed in the smaller-scale studies, which showed a preference for deep learning models. Several studies enhanced their methods with the active-, and transfer-learning approaches, constructing a scalable model. In the end, we strongly support that the interaction with citizens is of paramount importance to achieve a climate-neutral Earth.</jats:p>

AB  - There is no doubt that customer retention is vital for the service sector as companies’ revenue is significantly based on their customers’ financial returns. The prediction of customers who are at the risk of leaving a company’s services is not possible without using their connection details, support tickets and network traffic usage data. This paper demonstrates the importance of data mining and its outcome in the telecommunication area. The data in this paper are collected from different sources like Net Flow logs, call records and DNS query logs. These different types of data are aggregated together to decrease the missing information. Finally, machine learning algorithms are evaluated based on the customer dataset. The results of this study indicate that the gradient boosting algorithm performs better than other machine learning algorithms for this dataset.

AB  - <jats:p>Social production and life have become increasingly prominent. Cluster analysis is the basis for further processing of the data. The concept of data mining and the application of neural networks in data mining are introduced. According to the related technology of data mining, this article introduces in detail the two-layer perceptron, backpropagation (BP) neural network, RBF radial basis function network for processing classification problems, and self-organizing map (SOM) self-organizing neural network for unsupervised clustering problems. According to the characteristics of self-adaptive and self-organizing capabilities of these algorithms, we learn and design and implement data mining clustering optimization algorithms. In this paper, the neural network-based data mining process consists of three stages: data preparation, rule extraction, and rule evaluation. This paper studies the teaching-type and decomposition-type rule extraction algorithms. After analyzing the BP decomposition-type algorithm, the correlation method is used to calculate the correlation of the input and output neurons. After sorting by the degree of correlation, the RBF neural network is used for node selection. This can greatly reduce the number of input nodes of the neural network, simplify the network structure, reduce the number of recursive splits of the subnet, and improve calculation efficiency. Taking the model as an example, the training error is calculated through data mining technology and clustering algorithm. Data mining clustering optimization algorithm mainly improves the popular neural network from two aspects: finer model design and model pruning, and simulates model complexity, computational complexity, and errors through simulation experiments. The rate is measured, and finally, the simulation experiment is performed. The results show that the proposed algorithm for differential distributed data mining has higher accuracy and stronger convergence ability and overcomes the shortcomings and shortcomings of several original genetic algorithm optimization neural network data mining models; it can effectively improve the searchability and search accuracy of the algorithm and improve the efficiency of data mining. Accuracy and accuracy have a wide range of applications.</jats:p>

AB  - One of the most important properties of neural networks is the clustering of local minima of the loss function near the global minimum, enabling efficient training. Though generative models implemented on quantum computers are known to be more expressive than their traditional counterparts, it has empirically been observed that these models experience a transition in the quality of their local minima. Namely, below some critical number of parameters, all local minima are far from the global minimum in function value; above this critical parameter count, all local minima are good approximators of the global minimum. Furthermore, for a certain class of quantum generative models, this transition has empirically been observed to occur at parameter counts exponentially large in the problem size, meaning practical training of these models is out of reach. Here, we give the first proof of this transition in trainability, specializing to this latter class of quantum generative model. We use techniques inspired by those used to study the loss landscapes of classical neural networks. We also verify that our analytic results hold experimentally even at modest model sizes.

AB  - The identification of an effective inhibitor is an important starting step in drug development. Unfortunately, many issues such as the characterization of protein binding sites, the screening library, materials for assays, etc., make drug screening a difficult proposition. As the size of screening libraries increases, more resources will be inefficiently consumed. Thus, new strategies are needed to preprocess and focus a screening library towards a targeted protein. Herein, we report an ensemble machine learning (ML) model to generate a CDK8-focused screening library. The ensemble model consists of six different algorithms optimized for CDK8 inhibitor classification. The models were trained using a CDK8-specific fragment library along with molecules containing CDK8 activity. The optimized ensemble model processed a commercial library containing 1.6 million molecules. This resulted in a CDK8-focused screening library containing 1,672 molecules, a reduction of more than 99.90%. The CDK8-focused library was then subjected to molecular docking, and 25 candidate compounds were selected. Enzymatic assays confirmed six CDK8 inhibitors, with one compound producing an IC<sub>50</sub> value of ≤100 nM. Analysis of the ensemble ML model reveals the role of the CDK8 fragment library during training. Structural analysis of molecules reveals the hit compounds to be structurally novel CDK8 inhibitors. Together, the results highlight a pipeline for curating a focused library for a specific protein target, such as CDK8.

AB  - ABSTRACT Objective Develop a machine learning classifier for predicting the risk of cleavage-stage embryos to undergo first trimester miscarriage based on time-lapse images of preimplantation development. Design Retrospective study of a 4-year multi-center cohort of women undergoing intra-cytoplasmatic sperm injection (ICSI). The study included embryos with positive indication of clinical implantation based on gestational sac visualization either with first trimester miscarriage or live birth outcome. Miscarriage was determined based on negative fetal heartbeat indication during the first trimester. Setting Data were recorded and obtained in hospital setting and research was performed in university setting. Patient(s) Data from 391 women who underwent fresh single or double embryo transfers were included. Intervention(s) None. Main Outcome Measure(s) A minimal subset of six non-redundant morphodynamic features were screened that maintain high prediction capacity. Using this feature subset, XGBoost and Random Forest models were trained following a 100-fold Monte-Carlo cross validation scheme. Feature importance was scored using the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) methodology. Miscarriage versus live-birth outcome prediction was evaluated using a non-contaminated balanced test set and quantified in terms of the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC), precision-recall curve, positive predictive value (PPV), and confusion matrices. Result(s) Features that account for the distribution of the nucleolus precursor bodies within the small pronucleus and pronuclei dynamics were highly predictive of miscarriage outcome. AUC for miscarriage prediction of validation and test set embryos using both models was 0.68-to-0.69. Clinical utility was tested by setting two classification thresholds accounting for high sensitivity 0.73 with 0.6 specificity and high specificity 0.93 with 0.33 sensitivity. Conclusion(s) We report the development of a decision-support tool for identifying the embryos with high risk of miscarriage. Prioritizing embryos for transfer based on their predicted risk of miscarriage in combination with their predicted implantation potential will improve live-birth rates and shorten time-to-pregnancy. Capsule The risk of first trimester miscarriage of cleavage stage embryos is predicted with AUC 68% by screening a minimal subset of six non-redundant morpho-dynamic features and training a machine-learning classifier.

AB  - <jats:p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) and message passing neural networks (MPNNs) have been proven to be expressive for subgraph structures in many applications. Some applications in heterogeneous graphs require explicit edge modeling, such as subgraph isomorphism counting and matching. However, existing message passing mechanisms are not designed well in theory. In this paper, we start from a particular edge-to-vertex transform and exploit the isomorphism property in the edge-to-vertex dual graphs. We prove that searching isomorphisms on the original graph is equivalent to searching on its dual graph. Based on this observation, we propose dual message passing neural networks (DMPNNs) to enhance the substructure representation learning in an asynchronous way for subgraph isomorphism counting and matching as well as unsupervised node classification. Extensive experiments demonstrate the robust performance of DMPNNs by combining both node and edge representation learning in synthetic and real heterogeneous graphs.</jats:p>

AB  - <jats:p>In industry, electric motors such as the squirrel cage induction motor (SCIM) generate motive power and are particularly popular due to their low acquisition cost, strength, and robustness. Along with these benefits, they have minimal maintenance costs and can run for extended periods before requiring repair and/or maintenance. Early fault detection in SCIMs, especially at low-load conditions, further helps minimize maintenance costs and mitigate abrupt equipment failure when loading is increased. Recent research on these devices is focused on fault/failure diagnostics with the aim of reducing downtime, minimizing costs, and increasing utility and productivity. Data-driven predictive maintenance offers a reliable avenue for intelligent monitoring whereby signals generated by the equipment are harnessed for fault detection and isolation (FDI). Particularly, motor current signature analysis (MCSA) provides a reliable avenue for extracting and/or exploiting discriminant information from signals for FDI and/or fault diagnosis. This study presents a fault diagnostic framework that exploits underlying spectral characteristics following MCSA and intelligent classification for fault diagnosis based on extracted spectral features. Results show that the extracted features reflect induction motor fault conditions with significant diagnostic performance (minimal false alarm rate) from intelligent models, out of which the random forest (RF) classifier was the most accurate, with an accuracy of 79.25%. Further assessment of the models showed that RF had the highest computational cost of 3.66 s, while NBC had the lowest at 0.003 s. Other significant empirical assessments were conducted, and the results support the validity of the proposed FDI technique.</jats:p>

          <jats:p>Sports analytics has become both more professional and sophisticated, driven by the growing availability of detailed performance data. This progress enables applications such as match outcome prediction, player scouting, and tactical analysis. In soccer, the effective utilization of event and tracking data is fundamental for capturing and analyzing the dynamics of the game. However, there are two primary challenges: the limited availability of event data primarily restricted to top-tier teams and leagues, and the scarcity and high cost of tracking data, which complicates its integration with event data for comprehensive analysis. Here we propose OpenSTARLab (Open Spatio-Temporal Agent Research Lab), an open-source framework designed to democratize spatio-temporal agent data analysis in sports by addressing these key challenges. OpenSTARLab includes the Pre-processing Package that standardizes event and tracking data through Unified and Integrated Event Data and State-Action-Reward formats, the Event Modeling Package that implements deep learning-based event prediction, alongside the RLearn Package for reinforcement learning tasks. These technical components facilitate the handling of diverse data sources and support advanced analytical tasks, thereby enhancing the overall functionality and usability of the framework. To assess OpenSTARLab’s effectiveness, we conducted several experimental evaluations. These demonstrate the superior performance of the specific event prediction model in terms of action and time prediction accuracies and maintained its robust event simulation performance. Furthermore, reinforcement learning experiments reveal a trade-off between action accuracy and temporal difference loss and show comprehensive visualization. Overall, OpenSTARLab serves as a robust platform for researchers and practitioners, enhancing innovation and collaboration in the field of soccer data analytics.</jats:p>

However, an ability to better evaluate each player can translate into improved team performance, through better recruitment or team selection decisions. Two main ideas have emerged for using data to evaluate players: Top-down ratings observe the performance of the team as a whole and then distribute credit for this performance onto the players involved. Bottom-up ratings assign a value to each action performed, and then evaluate a player based on the sum of values for actions performed by that player. This paper compares a variant of plus-minus ratings, which is a top-down rating, and a bottom-up rating based on valuing actions by estimating probabilities. The reliability of ratings is measured by whether similar ratings are produced when using different data sets, while the validity of ratings is evaluated through the quality of match outcome forecasts generated when the ratings are used as predictor variables. The results indicate that the plus-minus ratings perform better than the bottom-up ratings with respect to the reliability and validity measures chosen and that plus-minus ratings have certain advantages that may be difficult to replicate in bottom-up ratings.</jats:p>

AB  - Land use (LU) and land cover (LC) are two complementary pieces of cartographic information used for urban planning and environmental monitoring. In the context of New Caledonia, a biodiversity hotspot, the availability of up-to-date LULC maps is essential to monitor the impact of extreme events such as cyclones and human activities on the environment. With the democratization of satellite data and the development of high-performance deep learning techniques, it is possible to create these data automatically. This work aims at determining the best current deep learning configuration (pixel-wise vs. semantic labelling architectures, data augmentation, image prepossessing, …), to perform LULC mapping in a complex, subtropical environment. For this purpose, a specific data set based on SPOT6 satellite data was created and made available for the scientific community as an LULC benchmark in a tropical, complex environment using five representative areas of New Caledonia labelled by a human operator: four used as training sets, and the fifth as a test set. Several architectures were trained and the resulting classification was compared with a state-of-the-art machine learning technique: XGboost. We also assessed the relevance of popular neo-channels derived from the raw observations in the context of deep learning. The deep learning approach showed comparable results to XGboost for LC detection and over-performed it on the LU detection task (61.45% vs. 51.56% of overall accuracy). Finally, adding LC classification output of the dedicated deep learning architecture to the raw channels input significantly improved the overall accuracy of the deep learning LU classification task (63.61% of overall accuracy). All the data used in this study are available on line for the remote sensing community and for assessing other LULC detection techniques.

AB  - The thyroid is an essential endocrine organ in human body, and thyroid hormones (THs) are pivotal signaling molecules and mediators in various physiological processes. THs, particularly in their free form, play a critical role in regulating body temperature and in the metabolism of lipid and glucose, making the maintenance of TH levels crucial for human health. THs undergo a series of metabolic processes, producing TH metabolites (THMs). THMs are significant in endocrine regulation, such as 3,5-diiothyronine (3,5-T2) and 3-iodothyronamine (3-T1AM), which exhibit activities akin to THs. The production and distribution of THMs are intricately linked to the function of specific organs and tissues, highlighting the need for advanced research into the determination and mechanisms of THMs in body. Exposure to endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) can significantly affect the levels of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) and THs. This review utilizes machine learning to analyze epidemiological data, identifying potential EDCs that pose risks of hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism. Additionally, it delves into the toxicological mechanisms of these EDCs, examining their effects on TH production, binding processes, related proteins, and metabolic enzymes. This approach effectively bridges the gap between epidemiological studies and toxicological researches, laying the groundwork for future research trends. By integrating epidemiological studies with machine learning, this review offers insightful perspectives on the potential risks associated with chemical exposure and underscores the necessity for further research in understanding the impact of EDCs on TH metabolism and TH-related health effects.

AB  - Metasurfaces have recently risen to prominence in optical research, providing unique functionalities that can be used for imaging, beam forming, holography, polarimetry, and many more, while keeping device dimensions small. Despite the fact that a vast range of basic metasurface designs has already been thoroughly studied in the literature, the number of metasurface-related papers is still growing at a rapid pace, as metasurface research is now spreading to adjacent fields, including computational imaging, augmented and virtual reality, automotive, display, biosensing, nonlinear, quantum and topological optics, optical computing, and more. At the same time, the ability of metasurfaces to perform optical functions in much more compact optical systems has triggered strong and constantly growing interest from various industries that greatly benefit from the availability of miniaturized, highly functional, and efficient optical components that can be integrated in optoelectronic systems at low cost. This creates a truly unique opportunity for the field of metasurfaces to make both a scientific and an industrial impact. The goal of this Roadmap is to mark this "golden age" of metasurface research and define future directions to encourage scientists and engineers to drive research and development in the field of metasurfaces toward both scientific excellence and broad industrial adoption.

AB  - A record of spatial and temporal parking occupancy is critical to optimize on-street parking resources and to develop effective parking policies. Such data are often obtained through advanced and costly occupancy monitoring technologies. Moreover, it is usually challenging to integrate bay-level occupancies and parking data from other systems. Accurate occupancy-payment data are required for a wide range of analytical and practical purposes, including but not limited to investigating payment behavior, estimating and forecasting occupancy, and evaluating the efficiency and effectiveness of enforcement policies. This study proposes a metaheuristic optimization algorithm to integrate snapshots of bay-level parking occupancy, captured using simple cameras, with transactions from a conventional parking payment management system. The resulting integrated data were used to develop, calibrate and validate a parking occupancy estimation method utilizing parking payment data only. Details of the design, implementation, and validation of the proposed algorithm and modelling technique are provided. Logistic regression analysis was used to tune parameters of the data integration algorithm. Deep learning, gradient boosting and random forests were used to develop a model of parking occupancy. Evaluation of the algorithm indicated an accuracy of 76% of correct data integration; that is, individual bay occupancies integrated with the correct corresponding payment transactions. The best occupancy estimation model also showed a very high accuracy, with an R 2 above 94% and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 1.2 (occupied bays), when tested with a random sample from the integrated data.

AB  - <jats:p>Abstract: Heart disease prediction and diagnosis have always been challenging tasks for medical experts. Hospitals and other medical facilities offer pricey procedures and treatments for cardiac diseases. As a result, being able to people all around the world can take the necessary actions to treat cardiac disease before it becomes severe if it is discovered in its early stages. The main causes of heart disease, a severe problem in recent years, are drinking alcohol, smoking cigarettes, and not exercising. A significant amount of data generated over time by the health care sector has allowed machine learning to offer efficient results in decision-making and prediction. We attempt to predict probable heart conditions in patients using machine learning approaches. In this project, we compare various classifiers, including decision trees, Naive Bayes, logistic regression, SVM, and random forests. We also suggest an ensemble classifier, which performs hybrid classification by combining the best features of both strong and weak classifiers and can handle large amounts of training and validation samples. We contrast already-in-use classifiers with others that have been proposed, such as Ada-boost and XGboost, which can offer higher accuracy. The main advantages of heart disease prediction using machine learning are that it manages the largest (enormous) quantity of data using the random forest algorithm and feature selection, as well as reducing the complexity of the doctors' time and being cost- and patient-friendly.</jats:p>

AB  - Online transactions have increased dramatically in this new 'Social-distancing' era. With online transactions, Fraud in online payments has also increased significantly. Frauds are a significant problem in various industries like insurance companies, baking, etc. These frauds include leaking of sensitive information related to the credit card which can be easily misused. Due to the government also pushing online transactions, E-commerce is on a boom. But due to increasing frauds in online payments, these E-commerce industries are suffering a great loss of trust from their customers. These companies are finding Credit card fraud to be a big problem. People have started using online payment options and thus are becoming easy targets of credit card fraud. In this research paper, we will be discussing machine learning algorithms. We have used Decision tree, XGBOOST, k-nearest neighbour, Logistic-regression, Random forest and SVM on a dataset in which there are transactions done online mode using Credit cards. We will test all these algorithms for detecting fraud cases using the confusion matrix, F1 score, and calculating the accuracy score for each model to identify which algorithm can be used in detecting frauds.

AB  - <jats:p>The present research uses machine learning, panel data and time series prediction and forecasting techniques to establish a framework between a series of renewable energy and environmental pollution parameters, considering data for BRICS, G7, and EU countries, which can serve as a tool for optimizing the policy strategy in the sustainable energy production sector. The results indicates that XGBoost model for predicting the renewable energy production capacity reveals the highest feature importance among independent variables is associated with the gas consumption parameter in the case of G7, oil consumption for EU block and GHG emissions for BRICS, respectively. Furthermore, the generalized additive model (GAM) predictions for the EU block reveal the scenario of relatively constant renewable energy capacity if gas consumption increases, while oil consumption increases determine an increase in renewable energy capacity until a kick point, followed by a decrease. The GAM models for G7 revealed the scenario of an upward trend of renewable energy production capacity, as gas consumption increases and renewable energy production capacity decreases while oil consumption increases. In the case of the BRICS geopolitical block, the prediction scenario reveals that, in time, an increase in gas consumption generates an increase in renewable energy production capacity. The PCA emphasizes that renewable energy production capacity and GHG, respectively CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> emissions, are highly correlated and are integrated into the first component, which explains more than 60% of the variance. The resulting models represent a good prediction capacity and reveal specific peculiarities for each analyzed geopolitical block. The prediction models conclude that the EU economic growth scenario is based on fossil fuel energy sources during the first development stage, followed by a shift to renewable energy sources once it reaches a kick point, during the second development stage. The decrease in renewable energy production capacity when oil consumption increases indicates that fossil fuels are in trend within the G7 economy. In the case of BRICS, it is assumed that gas consumption appears because of increasing the industrial capacity, followed by the increase of economic sustainability, respectively. In addition, the generalized additive models emphasize evolution scenarios with different peculiarities, specific for each analyzed geopolitical block.</jats:p>

AB  - <jats:p>The core focus of this review is to show how immediate and valid feedback, qualitative assessment influence enhances students learning in a higher education environment. With the rising trend of online education especially in this COVID-19 pandemic, the role of assessment and feedback also changes. Earlier the assessment part is not considered the main focus in learning and teaching in HEIs, but now with the increase in online education, it is observed that the paradigm is shifted toward assessing those activities of students that enhance their learning outcomes. A lot of research work has been done on developing assessment strategies and techniques that can support learning and teaching effectively. Yet, there is limited research that looks at how methods applied in learning analytics can be used and possibly constitutes the assessment process. The objective of this work is to provide an exploratory and comparative study of how assessment and feedback practices can enhance students learning outcomes using AI. The key contribution of this study attempts to capture an outline of the most used artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms for student success. The results showed that I-FCN performed better than other techniques (ANN, XG Boost, SVM, Random Forest, and Decision Trees) in all measured performance metrics. Also, the result of the comparative analysis study will help the educators, instructors, and administrators on how they could take the advantage of a data-driven approach, design less pressurized, more valid, reliable, constructive assessment findings, and connect the power of assessment and feedback to enhance the learning outcomes.</jats:p>

AB  - This study employs Bayesian methodologies to explore the influence of player or positional factors in predicting the probability of a shot resulting in a goal, measured by the expected goals (xG) metric. Utilising publicly available data from StatsBomb, Bayesian hierarchical logistic regressions are constructed, analysing approximately 10,000 shots from the English Premier League (for the years of 2003 and 2015) to ascertain whether positional or player-level effects impact xG. The findings reveal positional effects in a basic model that includes only distance to goal and shot angle as predictors, highlighting that strikers and attacking midfielders exhibit a higher likelihood of scoring. However, these effects diminish when more informative predictors are introduced. Nevertheless, even with additional predictors, player-level effects persist, indicating that certain players possess notable positive or negative xG adjustments, influencing their likelihood of scoring a given chance. The study extends its analysis to data from Spain's La Liga ( <mml:math xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mml:mrow><mml:mo>≈</mml:mo></mml:mrow> <mml:mn>20</mml:mn></mml:math> K shots from 1973 and 2004 to 2020) and Germany's Bundesliga ( <mml:math xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mml:mrow><mml:mo>≈</mml:mo></mml:mrow> <mml:mn>7.5</mml:mn></mml:math> K shots from 2015), yielding comparable results. Additionally, the paper assesses the impact of prior distribution choices on outcomes, concluding that the priors employed in the models provide sound results but could be refined to enhance sampling efficiency for constructing more complex and extensive models feasibly.

AB  - Heterogeneous catalysis plays a critical role in many industrial processes, including the production of fuels, chemicals, and pharmaceuticals, and research to improve current catalytic processes is important to make the chemical industry more sustainable. Despite its importance, the challenge of identifying optimal catalysts with the required activity and selectivity persists, demanding a detailed understanding of the complex interactions between catalysts and reactants at various length and time scales. Density functional theory (DFT) has been the workhorse in modeling heterogeneous catalysis for more than three decades. While DFT has been instrumental, this review explores the application of quantum computing algorithms in modeling heterogeneous catalysis, which could bring a paradigm shift in our approach to understanding catalytic interfaces. Bridging academic and industrial perspectives by focusing on emerging materials, such as multicomponent alloys, single-atom catalysts, and magnetic catalysts, we delve into the limitations of DFT in capturing strong correlation effects and spin-related phenomena. The review also presents important algorithms and their applications relevant to heterogeneous catalysis modeling to showcase advancements in the field. Additionally, the review explores embedding strategies where quantum computing algorithms handle strongly correlated regions, while traditional quantum chemistry algorithms address the remainder, thereby offering a promising approach for large-scale heterogeneous catalysis modeling. Looking forward, ongoing investments by academia and industry reflect a growing enthusiasm for quantum computing's potential in heterogeneous catalysis research. The review concludes by envisioning a future where quantum computing algorithms seamlessly integrate into research workflows, propelling us into a new era of computational chemistry and thereby reshaping the landscape of modeling heterogeneous catalysis.

AB  - We present a model-independent determination of the nuclear parton distribution functions (nPDFs) using machine learning methods and Monte Carlo techniques based on the NNPDF framework. The neutral-current deep-inelastic nuclear structure functions used in our previous analysis, nNNPDF1.0, are complemented by inclusive and charm-tagged cross-sections from charged-current scattering. Furthermore, we include all available measurements of W and Z leptonic rapidity distributions in proton-lead collisions from ATLAS and CMS at $$ \sqrt{s} $$
 = 5.02 TeV and 8.16 TeV. The resulting nPDF determination, nNNPDF2.0, achieves a good description of all datasets. In addition to quantifying the nuclear modifications affecting individual quarks and antiquarks, we examine the implications for strangeness, assess the role that the momentum and valence sum rules play in nPDF extractions, and present predictions for representative phenomenological applications. Our results, made available via the LHAPDF library, highlight the potential of high-energy collider measurements to probe nuclear dynamics in a robust manner.

AB  - Soccer is a sport characterised by open and dynamic play, with player actions and roles aligned according to team strategies simultaneously and at multiple temporal scales with high spatial freedom. This complexity presents an analytics challenge, which to date has largely been solved by decomposing the game according to specific criteria to analyse specific problems. We propose a more holistic approach, utilising Transformer or RNN components in the novel Seq2Event model, in which the next match event is predicted given prior match events and context. We show metric creation using a general purpose context-aware model as a deployable practical application, and demonstrate development of the poss-util metric using a Seq2Event model. Summarising the expectation of key attacking events (shot, cross) during each possession, our metric is shown to correlate over matches (r=0.91, n=190) with the popular xG metric. Example practical application of poss-util to analyse behaviour over possessions and matches is made. Potential in sports with stronger sequentiality, such as rugby union, is discussed.

AB  - Abstract The increasing access to brain signal data using electroencephalography creates new opportunities to study electrophysiological brain activity and perform ambulatory diagnoses of neurological disorders. This work proposes a pairwise distance learning approach for schizophrenia classification relying on the spectral properties of the signal. To be able to handle clinical trials with a limited number of observations (i.e. case and/or control individuals), we propose a Siamese neural network architecture to learn a discriminative feature space from pairwise combinations of observations per channel. In this way, the multivariate order of the signal is used as a form of data augmentation, further supporting the network generalization ability. Convolutional layers with parameters learned under a cosine contrastive loss are proposed to adequately explore spectral images derived from the brain signal. The proposed approach for schizophrenia diagnostic was tested on reference clinical trial data under resting-state protocol, achieving 0.95 ± 0.05 accuracy, 0.98 ± 0.02 sensitivity and 0.92 ± 0.07 specificity. Results show that the features extracted using the proposed neural network are remarkably superior than baselines to diagnose schizophrenia (+20pp in accuracy and sensitivity), suggesting the existence of non-trivial electrophysiological brain patterns able to capture discriminative neuroplasticity profiles among individuals. The code is available on Github: https://github.com/DCalhas/siamese_schizophrenia_eeg .

AB  - Time series gene expression data is widely used to study different dynamic biological processes. Although gene expression datasets share many of the characteristics of time series data from other domains, most of the analyses in this field do not fully leverage the time-ordered nature of the data and focus on clustering the genes based on their expression values. Other domains, such as financial stock and weather prediction, utilize time series data for forecasting purposes. Moreover, many studies have been conducted to classify generic time series data based on trend, seasonality, and other patterns. Therefore, an assessment of these approaches on gene expression data would be of great interest to evaluate their adequacy in this domain. Here, we perform a comprehensive evaluation of different traditional unsupervised and supervised machine learning approaches as well as deep learning based techniques for time series gene expression classification and forecasting on five real datasets. In addition, we propose deep learning based methods for both classification and forecasting, and compare their performances with the state-of-the-art methods. We find that deep learning based methods generally outperform traditional approaches for time series classification. Experiments also suggest that supervised classification on gene expression is more effective than clustering when labels are available. In time series gene expression forecasting, we observe that an autoregressive statistical approach has the best performance for short term forecasting, whereas deep learning based methods are better suited for long term forecasting.

AB  - Introduction: Renal ischemia reperfusion injury (IRI) is the major cause of acute kidney injury (AKI) which can progress to chronic kidney disease (CKD).In this study, we investigated the potential therapeutic effect of extracellular vesicles (EVs) derived from human liver stem cells (HLSCs) in an in vivo model of IRI-AKI, which subsequently develops into CKD Methods: EVs were purified by ultracentrifugation and characterized in accordance with ISEV-guidelines, by transmission electron microscopy, flow cytometry and Western Blot.BALB-c mice were subjected to 30 minutes IRI and EVs (1x109) were i.v.administered immediately after the surgery and three days after.To evaluate AKI, mice were sacrificed two and three days after the surgery, while to assess the development of CKD, mice were sacrificed two months after.Renal function and histological analyses were performed using specific kits and microscopic evaluation.By real time PCR analysis, we monitored the gene expression of markers of AKI, vascular damage, cell proliferation, fibrosis development, inflammation, and epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) Results: In AKI mice, EVs attenuated kidney damage by reducing tubular necrosis, increasing tubular cell proliferation and reducing damage-related gene expression.EV-treatment down-regulated the expression levels of vimentin, TWIST, and fibrosisrelated genes, while up-regulated ZO1 expression.In CKD mice, EVs effectively reduced the development of interstitial fibrosis at the histological level, confirmed at gene expression level by reduced levels of pro-fibrotic and pro-inflammatory genes.Molecular analysis of EMT markers showed increased ZO1 expression and decreased levels of mesenchymal genes in IRI mice treated with EVs Summary/Conclusion: The administration of HLSC-derived EVs immediately after renal IRI protects the kidney from AKI development and interferes with the development of subsequent interstitial fibrosis Funding: Unicyte AG (Switzerland)

AB  - <jats:p>According to the “World Population Prospects 2022” released by the United Nations in August 2022, the world will officially enter an “aging society”. In order to provide the elderly with an improved quality of daily life, “health promotion” and “prevention of disease” will be important. With respect to care of the elderly, the concepts of “therapeutic environment” and “green care” have been explored and developed. Therefore, in this study, we combine the currently popular Internet of Things (IoT) into an aquaponics system and proposes a smart green care system (SGCS). The proposed system uses face recognition technology to record the labor and rehabilitation history of the elderly, in combination with environmental data analysis, to enable automatic control decisions for equipment in conjunction with a voice control system to reduce the obstacles faced by the elderly in operating the information system. It also uses image recognition technology to monitor and notify about plant diseases and insect pests to achieve automatic management and enhance the interaction between the elderly and the SGCS through human–computer interaction. The SGCS allows the elderly to guide it to participate in appropriate activities through direct contact with the natural environment, thereby enhancing the quality of green healing life. In this study, taking long-term care institutions as an example, we verified proof of concept (PoC), proof of service (PoS), and proof of business (PoB), confirming the feasibility of the SGCS. The SGCS proposed in this study can be successfully used in long-term care institutions and various other environments, such as medical units and home care contexts. It can take full advantage of the functions associated with the concept of “healing environment” and “green care” widely recognized by users. Therefore, it can be widely used in the field of long-term care in the future.</jats:p>

AB  - <AbstractText Label="OBJECT" NlmCategory="OBJECTIVE">In a typical MR session, several contrasts are acquired. Due to the sequential nature of the data acquisition process, the patient may experience some discomfort at some point during the session, and start moving. Hence, it is quite common to have MR sessions where some contrasts are well-resolved, while other contrasts exhibit motion artifacts. Instead of repeating the scans that are corrupted by motion, we introduce a reference-guided retrospective motion correction scheme that takes advantage of the motion-free scans, based on a generalized rigid registration routine.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="MATERIALS AND METHODS" NlmCategory="METHODS">We focus on various existing clinical 3D brain protocols at 1.5 Tesla MRI based on Cartesian sampling. Controlled experiments with three healthy volunteers and three levels of motion are performed.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="RESULTS">Radiological inspection confirms that the proposed method consistently ameliorates the corrupted scans. Furthermore, for the set of specific motion tests performed in this study, the quality indexes based on PSNR and SSIM shows only a modest decrease in correction quality as a function of motion complexity.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="DISCUSSION" NlmCategory="CONCLUSIONS">While the results on controlled experiments are positive, future applications to patient data will ultimately clarify whether the proposed correction scheme satisfies the radiological requirements.</AbstractText>

AB  - In this shared task, we focus on detecting mental health signals in Reddit users' posts through two main challenges: A) capturing mood changes (anomalies) from the longitudinal set of posts (called timelines), and B) assessing the users' suicide risk-levels. Our approaches leverage emotion recognition on linguistic content by computing emotion/sentiment scores using pre-trained BERTs on users' posts and feeding them to machine learning models, including XGBoost, Bi-LSTM, and logistic regression. For Task-A, we detect longitudinal anomalies using a sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) autoencoder and capture regions of mood deviations. For Task-B, our two models utilize the BERT emotion/sentiment scores. The first computes emotion bandwidths and merges them with n-gram features, and employs logistic regression to detect users' suicide risk levels. The second model predicts suicide risk on the timeline level using a Bi-LSTM on Task-A results and sentiment scores. Our results outperformed most participating teams and ranked in the top three in Task-A. In Task-B, our methods surpass all others and return the best macro and micro F1 scores.

AB  - <p>Continuous passive sensing of daily behavior from mobile devices has the potential to identify behavioral patterns associated with different aspects of human characteristics. This paper presents novel analytic approaches to extract and understand these behavioral patterns and their impact on predicting adaptive and maladaptive personality traits. Our machine learning analysis extends previous research by showing that both adaptive and maladaptive traits are associated with passively sensed behavior providing initial evidence for the utility of this type of data to study personality and its pathology. The analysis also suggests directions for future confirmatory studies into the underlying behavior patterns that link adaptive and maladaptive variants consistent with contemporary models of personality pathology.</p>

AB  - The Fourth Industrial Revolution drives industries from traditional manufacturing to the smart manufacturing approach. In this transformation, existing equipment, processes, or devices are retrofitted with some sensors and other cyber-physical systems (CPS), and adapted towards digital production, which is a blend of critical enabling technologies. In the current scenario of Industry 4.0, industries are shaping themselves towards the development of customized and cost-effective processes to satisfy customer needs with the aid of a digital twin framework, which enables the user to monitor, simulate, control, optimize, and identify defects and trends within, ongoing process, and reduces the chances of human prone errors. This paper intends to make an appraisal of the literature on the digital twin (DT) framework in the domain of smart manufacturing with the aid of critical enabling technologies such as data-driven systems, machine learning and artificial intelligence, and deep learning. This paper also focuses on the concept, evolution, and background of digital twin and the benefits and challenges involved in its implementation. The Scopus and Web of Science databases from 2016 to 2021 were considered for the bibliometric analysis and used to study and analyze the articles that fall within the research theme. For the systematic bibliometric analysis, a novel approach known as Proknow-C was employed, including a series of procedures for article selection and filtration from the existing databases to get the most appropriate articles aligned with the research theme. Additionally, the authors performed statistical and network analyses on the articles within the research theme to identify the most prominent research areas, journal/conference, and authors in the field of a digital twin. This study identifies the current scenarios, possible research gaps, challenges in implementing DT, case studies and future research goals within the research theme.

AB  - Multimessenger searches for binary neutron star (BNS) and neutron star-black hole (NSBH) mergers are currently one of the most exciting areas of astronomy. The search for joint electromagnetic and neutrino counterparts to gravitational wave (GW)s has resumed with ALIGO's, AdVirgo's and KAGRA's fourth observing run (O4). To support this effort, public semiautomated data products are sent in near real-time and include localization and source properties to guide complementary observations. In preparation for O4, we have conducted a study using a simulated population of compact binaries and a mock data challenge (MDC) in the form of a real-time replay to optimize and profile the software infrastructure and scientific deliverables. End-toend performance was tested, including data ingestion, running online search pipelines, performing annotations, and issuing alerts to the astrophysics community. We present an overview of the low-latency infrastructure and the performance of the data products that are now being released during O4 based on the MDC. We report the expected median latency for the preliminary alert of full bandwidth searches (29.5 s) and show consistency and accuracy of released data products using the MDC. We report the expected median latency for triggers from early warning searches (-3.1 s), which are new in O4 and target neutron star mergers during inspiral phase. This paper provides a performance overview for LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) low-latency alert infrastructure and data products using theMDCand serves as a useful reference for the interpretation of O4 detections.

AB  - Microrheology encompasses a range of methods to measure the mechanical properties of soft materials. By characterizing the motion of embedded microscopic particles, microrheology extends the probing length scale and frequency range of conventional bulk rheology. Microrheology can be characterized into either passive or active methods based on the driving force exerted on probe particles. Tracer particles are driven by thermal energy in passive methods, applying minimal deformation to the assessed medium. In active techniques, particles are manipulated by an external force, most commonly produced through optical and magnetic fields. Small-scale rheology holds significant advantages over conventional bulk rheology, such as eliminating the need for large sample sizes, the ability to probe fragile materials non-destructively, and a wider probing frequency range. More importantly, some microrheological techniques can obtain spatiotemporal information of local microenvironments and accurately describe the heterogeneity of structurally complex fluids. Recently, there has been significant growth in using these minimally invasive techniques to investigate a wide range of biomedical systems both <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>. Here, we review the latest applications and advancements of microrheology in mammalian cells, tissues, and biofluids and discuss the current challenges and potential future advances on the horizon.

AB  - Parkinson's disease (PD) and atypical Parkinsonian syndromes are progressive heterogeneous neurodegenerative diseases that share clinical characteristic of parkinsonism as a common feature, but are considered distinct clinicopathological disorders. Based on the predominant protein aggregates observed within the brain, these disorders are categorized as, (1) α-synucleinopathies, which include PD and other Lewy body spectrum disorders as well as multiple system atrophy, and (2) tauopathies, which comprise progressive supranuclear palsy and corticobasal degeneration. Although, great strides have been made in neurodegenerative disease research since the first medical description of PD in 1817 by James Parkinson, these disorders remain a major diagnostic and treatment challenge. A valid diagnosis at early disease stages is of paramount importance, as it can help accommodate differential prognostic and disease management approaches, enable the elucidation of reliable clinicopathological relationships ideally at prodromal stages, as well as facilitate the evaluation of novel therapeutics in clinical trials. However, the pursuit for early diagnosis in PD and atypical Parkinsonian syndromes is hindered by substantial clinical and pathological heterogeneity, which can influence disease presentation and progression. Therefore, reliable neuroimaging biomarkers are required in order to enhance diagnostic certainty and ensure more informed diagnostic decisions. In this article, an updated presentation of well-established and emerging neuroimaging biomarkers are reviewed from the following modalities: (1) structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), (2) diffusion-weighted and diffusion tensor MRI, (3) resting-state and task-based functional MRI, (4) proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy, (5) transcranial B-mode sonography for measuring substantia nigra and lentiform nucleus echogenicity, (6) single photon emission computed tomography for assessing the dopaminergic system and cerebral perfusion, and (7) positron emission tomography for quantifying nigrostriatal functions, glucose metabolism, amyloid, tau and α-synuclein molecular imaging, as well as neuroinflammation. Multiple biomarkers obtained from different neuroimaging modalities can provide distinct yet corroborative information on the underlying neurodegenerative processes. This integrative "multimodal approach" may prove superior to single modality-based methods. Indeed, owing to the international, multi-centered, collaborative research initiatives as well as refinements in neuroimaging technology that are currently underway, the upcoming decades will mark a pivotal and exciting era of further advancements in this field of neuroscience.

AB  - <jats:p>In this work, we investigate the recognition of human emotional states from audiovisual signals. We extract prosodic, Mel-frequency Cepstral Coeffieient (MFCC), and formant frequency features to represent the audio characteristic of the emotional speech. A face detection scheme based on HSV color model is used to detect the face from the background. The facial expressions are represented by Gabor wavelet features. We perform feature selection by using the stepwise method based on Mahalanobis distance. The selected features are used to classify the emotional data into their corresponding classes. Different classification algorithms including Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), K-nearest neighbours(K-NN), Neural Network (NN), and Fisher's Linear Discriminant Analysis (FLDA) are compared in this study. An adaptive multi-classifier scheme involving the analysis of individual class and combinations of different classes is proposed. Our recognition system is tested over a language independent database. The proposed FLDA-based multi-classifier scheme achieves the best overall and individual class recognition accuracy.</jats:p>

AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>ALS (Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease of the human motor system. It is a group of progressive diseases that affects the nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord that control the muscle movement of the body hence, detection and classification of ALS at the right time is considered to be one of the vital aspects that can save the life of humans. Therefore, in various studies, different AI techniques are used for the detection of ALS, however, these methods are considered to be ineffectual in terms of identifying the disease due to the employment of ineffective algorithms. Hence, the proposed model utilizes Modified Principal Component Analysis (MPCA) and Modified Random Forest (MRF) for performing dimensionality reduction of all the potential features considered for effective classification of the ALS presence and absence of ALS causing mutation in the corresponding gene. The MPCA is adapted for capturing all the Low-Importance Data transformation. Furthermore, The MPCA is objected to performing three various approaches: Covariance Matrix Correlation, Eigen Vector- Eigenvalue decomposition, and selecting the desired principal components. This is done in aspects of implying the LI (Lower-Importance) Data Transformation. By choosing these potential components without any loss of features ensures better viability of selecting the attributes for ALS-causing gene classification. This is followed by the classification of the proposed model by using Modified RF by updating the clump detector technique. The clump detector is proceeded by clustering approach using K-means, and the data reduced by their dimension are grouped accordingly. These clustered data are analyzed either for ALS causing or devoid of causing ALS. Finally, the model’s performance is assessed using different evaluation metrics like accuracy, recall, F1 score, and precision, and the proposed model is further compared with the existing models to assess the efficacy of the proposed model.</jats:p>

AB  - Power and energy systems around the world are expanding and evolving in tandem with technological advancement. In the current scenario, energy is a crucial requirement for the development for any country. Machine learning (ML) is used as a technology to address the requirement for quicker and more accurate analyses that would support the control and operation of modern power systems. In this paper, analysis is performed using Machine Learning and Deep Learning (DL) models to predict power estimation at a photovoltaic (PV) solar site with the capacity of 79.95 kW, installed in Dhar district, Madhya Pradesh (MP), India. The model's accuracy is evaluated using various statistical parameters, R2 score, Mean Square Error (MAE), Root Means Square Error (RMSE), Mean Square Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Absolute Percent Error (MAPE) and variance. The proposed method Linear Regression (LR) algorithm shows a maximum R2 score of 0.99994, a small error metric of MAE 0.0091, and an RMSE of 0.121, which indicate the highest accuracy model as compared to other algorithms. Accurate prediction of solar power without irradiance, season-wise (five seasons in India) and month-wise, is also predicted with high accuracy using ten different models of machine learning and one deep learning method, with comparison of its results with the existing work.

AB  - <AbstractText Label="BACKGROUND" NlmCategory="BACKGROUND">Children with congenital and acquired heart disease are at a higher risk of cardiac arrest compared to those without heart disease. Although the monitoring of cardiopulmonary resuscitation quality and extracorporeal resuscitation technologies have advanced, survival after cardiac arrest in this population has not improved. Cardiac arrest prevention, using predictive algorithms with machine learning, has the potential to reduce cardiac arrest rates. However, few studies have evaluated the use of these algorithms in predicting cardiac arrest in children with heart disease.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="METHODS" NlmCategory="METHODS">We collected demographic, laboratory, and vital sign information from the electronic health records (EHR) of all the patients that were admitted to a single-center pediatric cardiac intensive care unit (CICU), between 2010 and 2019, who had a cardiac arrest during their CICU admission, as well as a comparator group of randomly selected non-cardiac-arrest controls. We compared traditional logistic regression modeling against a novel adaptation of a machine learning algorithm (functional gradient boosting), using time series data to predict the risk of cardiac arrest.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="RESULTS">A total of 160 unique cardiac arrest events were matched to non-cardiac-arrest time periods. Using 11 different variables (vital signs and laboratory values) from the EHR, our algorithm's peak performance for the prediction of cardiac arrest was at one hour prior to the cardiac arrest (AUROC of 0.85 [0.79,0.90]), a performance that was similar to our previously published multivariable logistic regression model.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="CONCLUSIONS" NlmCategory="CONCLUSIONS">Our novel machine learning predictive algorithm, which was developed using retrospective data that were collected from the EHR and predicted cardiac arrest in the children that were admitted to a single-center pediatric cardiac intensive care unit, demonstrated a performance that was similar to that of a traditional logistic regression model. While these results are encouraging, future research, including prospective validations with multicenter data, is warranted prior to the implementation of this algorithm as a real-time clinical decision support tool.</AbstractText>

AB  - The etiological agent of syphilis, <i>Treponema pallidum</i> ssp. <i>pallidum</i>, is a highly invasive "stealth" pathogen that can evade the host immune response and persist within the host for decades. This obligate human pathogen is adept at establishing infection and surviving at sites within the host that have a multitude of competing microbes, sometimes including pathogens. One survival strategy employed by bacteria found at polymicrobial sites is elimination of competing microorganisms by production of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs). Antimicrobial peptides are low molecular weight proteins (miniproteins) that function directly via inhibition and killing of microbes and/or indirectly via modulation of the host immune response, which can facilitate immune evasion. In the current study, we used bioinformatics to show that approximately 7% of the <i>T. pallidum</i> proteome is comprised of miniproteins of 150 amino acids or less with unknown functions. To investigate the possibility that AMP production is an unrecognized defense strategy used by <i>T. pallidum</i> during infection, we developed a bioinformatics pipeline to analyze the complement of <i>T. pallidum</i> miniproteins of unknown function for the identification of potential AMPs. This analysis identified 45 <i>T. pallidum</i> AMP candidates; of these, Tp0451a and Tp0749 were subjected to further bioinformatic analyses to identify AMP critical core regions (AMPCCRs). Four potential AMPCCRs from the two predicted AMPs were identified and peptides corresponding to these AMPCCRs were experimentally confirmed to exhibit bacteriostatic and bactericidal activity against a panel of biologically relevant Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Immunomodulation assays performed under inflammatory conditions demonstrated that one of the AMPCCRs was also capable of differentially regulating expression of two pro-inflammatory chemokines [monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) and interleukin-8 (IL-8)]. These findings demonstrate proof-of-concept for our developed AMP identification pipeline and are consistent with the novel concept that <i>T. pallidum</i> expresses AMPs to defend against competing microbes and modulate the host immune response.

AB  - Widespread concerns over the impact of human activity on the environment have resulted in a desire to replace artificial functional materials with naturally derived alternatives. As such, polysaccharides are drawing increasing attention due to offering a renewable, biodegradable, and biocompatible feedstock for functional nanomaterials. In particular, nanocrystals of cellulose and chitin have emerged as versatile and sustainable building blocks for diverse applications, ranging from mechanical reinforcement to structural coloration. Much of this interest arises from the tendency of these colloidally stable nanoparticles to self-organize in water into a lyotropic cholesteric liquid crystal, which can be readily manipulated in terms of its periodicity, structure, and geometry. Importantly, this helicoidal ordering can be retained into the solid-state, offering an accessible route to complex nanostructured films, coatings, and particles. In this review, the process of forming iridescent, structurally colored films from suspensions of cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) is summarized and the mechanisms underlying the chemical and physical phenomena at each stage in the process explored. Analogy is then drawn with chitin nanocrystals (ChNCs), allowing for key differences to be critically assessed and strategies toward structural coloration to be presented. Importantly, the progress toward translating this technology from academia to industry is summarized, with unresolved scientific and technical questions put forward as challenges to the community.

AB  - Robust automatic speech emotional-speech recognition architectures based on hybrid convolutional neural networks (CNN) and feedforward deep neural networks are proposed and named in this paper as: BFN, CNA, and HBN. BFN is a combination between bag-of-Audio-word (BoAW) and feedforward deep neural network, CNA based on CNN, finally, HBN is hybrid architecture between BFN and CNA. Overall accuracy is achieved by leveraging Mel-frequency cepstral coefficient features and bag-of-acoustic-words to feed the network, resulting in promising classification performance. In addition, the concatenated output from the proposed hybrid networks is fed into a softmax layer to produce a probability distribution over categorical classifications for speech recognition. The three proposed models are trained on eight emotional classes from the Ryerson Audio-Visual Database of Emotional Speech and Song audio (RAVDESS) dataset. Our proposed models achieved overall precision between 81.5% and 85.5% and overall accuracy between 80.6% and 84.5%, hence outperforming state-of-the-art models using the same dataset.

AB  - <AbstractText Label="Background" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">Neuropsychopharmacological compounds may exert complex brain-wide effects due to an anatomically and genetically broad expression of their molecular targets and indirect effects <i>via</i> interconnected brain circuits. Electrophysiological measurements in multiple brain regions using electroencephalography (EEG) or local field potential (LFP) depth-electrodes may record fingerprints of such pharmacologically-induced changes in local activity and interregional connectivity (pEEG/pLFP). However, in order to reveal such patterns comprehensively and potentially derive mechanisms of therapeutic pharmacological effects, both activity and connectivity have to be estimated for many brain regions. This entails the problem that hundreds of electrophysiological parameters are derived from a typically small number of subjects, making frequentist statistics ill-suited for their analysis.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="Methods" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">We here present an optimized interpretable machine-learning (ML) approach which relies on predictive power in individual recording sequences to extract and quantify the robustness of compound-induced neural changes from multi-site recordings using Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) values. To evaluate this approach, we recorded LFPs in mediodorsal thalamus (MD), prefrontal cortex (PFC), dorsal hippocampus (CA1 and CA3), and ventral hippocampus (vHC) of mice after application of amphetamine or of the dopaminergic antagonists clozapine, raclopride, or SCH23390, for which effects on directed neural communication between those brain structures were so far unknown.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="Results" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">Our approach identified complex patterns of neurophysiological changes induced by each of these compounds, which were reproducible across time intervals, doses (where tested), and ML algorithms. We found, for example, that the action of clozapine in the analysed cortico-thalamo-hippocampal network entails a larger share of D1-as opposed to D2-receptor induced effects, and that the D2-antagonist raclopride reconfigures connectivity in the delta-frequency band. Furthermore, the effects of amphetamine and clozapine were surprisingly similar in terms of decreasing thalamic input to PFC and vHC, and vHC activity, whereas an increase of dorsal-hippocampal communication and of thalamic activity distinguished amphetamine from all tested anti-dopaminergic drugs.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="Conclusion" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">Our study suggests that communication from the dorsal hippocampus scales proportionally with dopamine receptor activation and demonstrates, more generally, the high complexity of neuropharmacological effects on the circuit level. We envision that the presented approach can aid in the standardization and improved data extraction in pEEG/pLFP-studies.</AbstractText>

AB  - <jats:p>Statistics affirm that almost half of deaths in traffic accidents were vulnerable road users, such as pedestrians, cyclists, and motorcyclists. Despite the efforts in technological infrastructure and traffic policies, the number of victims remains high and beyond expectation. Recent research establishes that determining the causes of traffic accidents is not an easy task because their occurrence depends on one or many factors. Traffic accidents can be caused by, for instance, mechanical problems, adverse weather conditions, mental and physical fatigue, negligence, potholes in the road, among others. At present, the use of learning-based prediction models as mechanisms to reduce the number of traffic accidents is a reality. In that way, the success of prediction models depends mainly on how data from different sources can be integrated and correlated. This study aims to report models, algorithms, data sources, attributes, data collection services, driving simulators, evaluation metrics, percentages of data for training/validation/testing, and others. We found that the performance of a prediction model depends mainly on the quality of its data and a proper data split configuration. The use of real data predominates over data generated by simulators. This work made it possible to determine that future research must point to developing traffic accident prediction models that use deep learning. It must also focus on exploring and using data sources, such as driver data and light conditions, and solve issues related to this type of solution, such as high dimensionality in data and information imbalance.</jats:p>

AB  - <jats:p>The two most frequently heard terms in the mining industry are safety and production. These two terms put a lot of pressure on blasting engineers and crew to give more while consuming less. The key to achieving the optimum blasting results is sophisticated bench analysis, which must be combined with design blast parameters for good fragmentation and safe ground vibration. Thus, a unique solution for forecasting both optimum fragmentation and reduced ground vibration using rock mass joint angle and blast design parameters will aid the blasting operations in terms of cost savings. To arrive at a proper understanding and a solution, 152 blasts were carried out in various mines by adjusting blast design parameters concerning the measured joint angle. The XG Boost, K-Nearest Neighbor, and Random Forest algorithms were evaluated, and the XG Boost outputs were shown to be superior in terms of Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and Co-efficient of determination (R2) values. Using XG Boost, the decision-tree-based ensemble Machine Learning algorithm that uses a gradient-boosting framework and a simultaneous formula was developed to predict both fragmentation and ground vibration using joint angle and the same set of parameters.</jats:p>

AB  - Analysis of the popular expected goals (xG) metric in soccer has determined that a (slightly) smaller number of high-quality attempts will likely yield more goals than a slew of low-quality ones. This observation has driven a change in shooting behavior. Teams are passing up on shots from outside the penalty box, in the hopes of generating a better shot closer to goal later on. This paper evaluates whether this decrease in long-distance shots is warranted. Therefore, we propose a novel generic framework to reason about decision-making in soccer by combining techniques from machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI). First, we model how a team has behaved offensively over the course of two seasons by learning a Markov Decision Process (MDP) from event stream data. Second, we use reasoning techniques arising from the AI literature on verification to each team's MDP. This allows us to reason about the efficacy of certain potential decisions by posing counterfactual questions to the MDP. Our key conclusion is that teams would score more goals if they shot more often from outside the penalty box in a small number of team-specific locations. The proposed framework can easily be extended and applied to analyze other aspects of the game.

AB  - <jats:p>The time derivative of acceleration, termed jerk, represents a physical property reflected through a sudden change of acceleration, and is expressed in m/s3. Since jerk is felt by humans, it has been widely used as a common (dis)comfort parameter. In earthquake engineering, due to the inevitable need for further progress in understanding ground motions and soil, structural and non-structural responses, new frontiers need to be examined. Therefore, lately, there has been an increasing interest in jerk, and various research efforts have been made towards its applications. Since a proper overview of the jerk-related literature applicable to earthquake engineering is missing, the main purpose of this paper is to fill the gap and provide a starting point for future studies.</jats:p>

AB  - <jats:p>Solar photovoltaic (PV) electricity generation is growing rapidly in China. Accurate estimation of solar energy resource potential (Rs) is crucial for siting, designing, evaluating and optimizing PV systems. Seven types of tree-based ensemble models, including classification and regression trees (CART), extremely randomized trees (ET), random forest (RF), gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), gradient boosting with categorical features support (CatBoost) and light gradient boosting method (LightGBM), as well as the multi-layer perceotron (MLP) and support vector machine (SVM), were applied to estimate Rs using a k-fold cross-validation method. The three newly developed models (CatBoost, LighGBM, XGBoost) and GBDT model generally outperformed the other five models with satisfactory accuracy (R2 ranging from 0.893–0.916, RMSE ranging from 1.943–2.195 MJm−2d−1, and MAE ranging from 1.457–1.646 MJm−2d−1 on average) and provided acceptable model stability (increasing the percentage in testing RMSE over training RMSE from 8.3% to 31.9%) under seven input combinations. In addition, the CatBoost (12.3 s), LightGBM (13.9 s), XGBoost (20.5 s) and GBDT (16.8 s) exhibited satisfactory computational efficiency compared with the MLP (132.1 s) and SVM (256.8 s). Comprehensively considering the model accuracy, stability and computational time, the newly developed tree-based models (CatBoost, LighGBM, XGBoost) and commonly used GBDT model were recommended for modeling Rs in contrasting climates of China and possibly similar climatic zones elsewhere around the world. This study evaluated three newly developed tree-based ensemble models of estimating Rs in various climates of China, from model accuracy, model stability and computational efficiency, which provides a new look at indicators of evaluating machine learning methods.</jats:p>

AB  - <jats:p>The last decades have witnessed significant advancements in terms of data generation, management, and maintenance. This has resulted in vast amounts of data becoming available in a variety of forms and formats including RDF. As RDF data is represented as a graph structure, applying machine learning algorithms to extract valuable knowledge and insights from them is not straightforward, especially when the size of the data is enormous. Although Knowledge Graph Embedding models (KGEs) convert the RDF graphs to low-dimensional vector spaces, these vectors often lack the explainability. On the contrary, in this paper, we introduce a generic, distributed, and scalable software framework that is capable of transforming large RDF data into an explainable feature matrix. This matrix can be exploited in many standard machine learning algorithms. Our approach, by exploiting semantic web and big data technologies, is able to extract a variety of existing features by deep traversing a given large RDF graph. The proposed framework is open-source, well-documented, and fully integrated into the active community project Semantic Analytics Stack (SANSA). The experiments on real-world use cases disclose that the extracted features can be successfully used in machine learning tasks like classification and clustering.</jats:p>

AB  - Thermochemical Energy Storage (TCES), specifically the calcium oxide (CaO)/calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH)2) system is a promising energy storage technology with relatively high energy density and low cost. However, the existing models available to predict the system’s internal states are computationally expensive. An accurate and real-time capable model is therefore still required to improve its operational control. In this work, we implement a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) to predict the dynamics of the TCES internal state. Our proposed framework addresses three physical aspects to build the PINN: (1) we choose a Nonlinear Autoregressive Network with Exogeneous Inputs (NARX) with deeper recurrence to address the nonlinear latency; (2) we train the network in closed-loop to capture the long-term dynamics; and (3) we incorporate physical regularisation during its training, calculated based on discretized mole and energy balance equations. To train the network, we perform numerical simulations on an ensemble of system parameters to obtain synthetic data. Even though the suggested approach provides results with the error of 3.96×10−4 which is in the same range as the result without physical regularisation, it is superior compared to conventional Artificial Neural Network (ANN) strategies because it ensures physical plausibility of the predictions, even in a highly dynamic and nonlinear problem. Consequently, the suggested PINN can be further developed for more complicated analysis of the TCES system.

AB  - <jats:p>Abstract: This is an extremely contentious subject of study as many people across the world don't believe that humans are responsible for climate change. There will be an urgent requirement for adaptation as a result of the effects of climate change on human society, as this is the only way that humans can hope to survive the increasingly chaotic weather of the future. The rapid development of machine learning (ML) algorithms has sparked innovations in numerous fields of study and has even been proposed as improving climate studies. Since global warming has an effect on not just people but also on many other kinds of animals, efforts to bring it down may benefit everyone on Earth. To examine the global climate's development since 1800, we use machine learning methods. From land average temperature to land average temperature uncertainty (95% CI around the mean), land maximum temperature to land average temperature uncertainty, land minimum temperature to land average temperature uncertainty, land and ocean average temperature to land and ocean average temperature uncertainty, and more. Kaggle datasets show a wide range of temperature change metrics since 1750. Another dataset measures the average worldwide concentration of carbon monoxide since 1958; it was compiled by the Earth System Research Laboratory of the United States Government. We propose focusing equally on machine learning and artificial intelligence to better interpret and profit from current data and simulation. Our findings provide insight into the difficulties and potential benefits of data-driven climate modeling, particularly about the future integration of increasingly enormous model datasets.</jats:p>

AB  - <jats:p>A decentralized power grid is a modern system that implements demand response without requiring major infrastructure changes. In decentralization, the consumers regulate their electricity demand autonomously based on the grid frequency. With cheap equipment (i.e., smart meters), the grid frequency can be easily measured anywhere. Electrical grids need to be stable to balance electricity supply and demand to ensure economically and dynamically viable grid operation. The volumes of electricity consumed/produced (p) by each grid participant, cost-sensitivity (g), and grid participants’ response times (tau) to changing grid conditions affect the stability of the grid. Renewable energy resources are volatile on varying time scales. Due to the volatile nature of these renewable energy resources, there are more frequent fluctuations in decentralized grids integrating renewable energy resources. The decentralized grid is designed by linking real-time electricity rates to the grid frequency over a few seconds to provide demand-side control. In this study, a model has been proposed to predict the stability of a decentralized power grid. The simulated data obtained from the online machine learning repository has been employed. Data normalization has been employed to reduce the biased behavior among attributes. Various data level resampling techniques have been used to address the issue of data imbalance. The results showed that a balanced dataset outperformed an imbalanced dataset regarding classifiers’ performance. It has also been observed that oversampling techniques proved better than undersampling techniques and imbalanced datasets. Overall, the XGBoost algorithm outperformed all other machine learning algorithms based on performance. XGBoost has been given an accuracy of 94.7%, but while combining XGBoost with random oversampling, its accuracy prediction has been improved to 96.8%. This model can better predict frequency fluctuations in decentralized power grids and the volatile nature of renewable energy resources resulting in better utilization. This prediction may contribute to the stability of a decentralized power grid for better distribution and management of electricity.</jats:p>

AB  - While extensive research has gone into demand response techniques in data centers, the energy consumed in edge computing systems and in network data transmission remains a significant part of the computing industry’s carbon footprint. The industry also has not fully leveraged the parallel trend of decentralized renewable energy generation, which creates new areas of opportunity for innovation in combined energy and computing systems. Through an interdisciplinary sociotechnical discussion of current energy, computer science and social studies of science and technology (STS) literature, we argue that a more comprehensive set of carbon response techniques needs to be developed that span the continuum of data centers, from the back-end cloud to the network edge. Such techniques need to address the combined needs of decentralized energy and computing systems, alongside the social power dynamics those combinations entail. We call this more comprehensive range “carbon-responsive computing,” and underscore that this continuum constitutes the beginnings of an interconnected infrastructure, elements of which are data-intensive and require the integration of social science disciplines to adequately address problems of inequality, governance, transparency, and definitions of “necessary” tasks in a climate crisis.

AB  - High hydrostatic pressure (HHP) is a key driver of life's evolution and diversification on Earth. Icy moons such as Titan, Europa, and Enceladus harbor potentially habitable high-pressure environments within their subsurface oceans. Titan, in particular, is modeled to have subsurface ocean pressures ≥ 150 MPa, which are above the highest pressures known to support life on Earth in natural ecosystems. Piezophiles are organisms that grow optimally at pressures higher than atmospheric (0.1 MPa) pressure and have specialized adaptations to the physical constraints of high-pressure environments - up to ~110 MPa at Challenger Deep, the highest pressure deep-sea habitat explored. While non-piezophilic microorganisms have been shown to survive short exposures at Titan relevant pressures, the mechanisms of their survival under such conditions remain largely unelucidated. To better understand these mechanisms, we have conducted a study of gene expression for <i>Shewanella oneidensis</i> MR-1 using a high-pressure experimental culturing system. MR-1 was subjected to short-term (15 min) and long-term (2 h) HHP of 158 MPa, a value consistent with pressures expected near the top of Titan's subsurface ocean. We show that MR-1 is metabolically active <i>in situ</i> at HHP and is capable of viable growth following 2 h exposure to 158 MPa, with minimal pressure training beforehand. We further find that MR-1 regulates 264 genes in response to short-term HHP, the majority of which are upregulated. Adaptations include upregulation of the genes <i>argA, argB, argC</i>, and <i>argF</i> involved in arginine biosynthesis and regulation of genes involved in membrane reconfiguration. MR-1 also utilizes stress response adaptations common to other environmental extremes such as genes encoding for the cold-shock protein CspG and antioxidant defense related genes. This study suggests Titan's ocean pressures may not limit life, as microorganisms could employ adaptations akin to those demonstrated by terrestrial organisms.

Especially for the essential and time-consuming planning of logistics processes in a contract logistics project, experienced planners are required. However, the growing shortage of skilled workers makes recruiting these planners increasingly difficult. Hence, a supervised learning approach will be investigated to support especially inexperienced planners in process planning. This article explores how supervised learning can extract the process knowledge contained in legacy contract logistics project documentation to suggest process steps during a new project process planning. The investigation results in boosted decision trees predicting the next process step correctly in 81% of the cases.

AB  - The Internet of Everything is currently in demand and has burdened the network tremendously. Accommodating this exponential increase in demand will require improved Radio Resource Management technology. This problem can be curbed with higher spectrum bands, reevaluation of Time Division Duplex, deployment of Software Defined Network, and Network Function Virtualization into 5G New Radio (NR) network. Therefore, this work aims to provide an in-depth survey on the recent resource management schemes that can be proposed for 5G NR enhancement by exploiting both rule-based algorithms and machine learning methods. Radio resource management consists of managing user allocation, the antenna transmission power, bandwidth, and modulation scheme. Therefore, in this paper, three categories of radio resource management technologies are introduced: resource allocation, energy efficiency, and interference management. The discussion revolves around their potentials and contributions as well as challenges faced to produce efficient 5G resource management schemes.

AB  - <AbstractText Label="BACKGROUND" NlmCategory="BACKGROUND">Acute neurological complications are some of the leading causes of death and disability in the U.S. The medical professionals that treat patients in this setting are tasked with deciding where (e.g., home or facility), how, and when to discharge these patients. It is important to be able to predict potential patient discharge outcomes as early as possible during the patient's hospital stay and to know what factors influence the development of discharge planning. This study carried out two parallel experiments: A multi-class outcome (patient discharge targets of 'home', 'nursing facility', 'rehab', 'death') and binary class outcome ('home' vs. 'non-home'). The goal of this study is to develop early predictive models for each experiment exploring which patient characteristics and clinical variables significantly influence discharge planning of patients based on the data that are available only within 24 h of their hospital admission.  METHOD: Our methodology centers around building and training five different machine learning models followed by testing and tuning those models to find the best-suited predictor for each experiment with a dataset of 5,245 adult patients with neurological conditions taken from the eICU-CRD database.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="RESULTS">The results of this study show XGBoost to be the most effective model for predicting between four common discharge outcomes of 'home', 'nursing facility', 'rehab', and 'death', with 71% average c-statistic. The XGBoost model was also the best-performer in the binary outcome experiment with a c-statistic of 76%. This article also explores the accuracy, reliability, and interpretability of the best performing models in each experiment by identifying and analyzing the features that are most impactful to the predictions.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="CONCLUSIONS" NlmCategory="CONCLUSIONS">The acceptable accuracy and interpretability of the predictive models based on early admission data suggests that the models can be used in a suggestive context to help guide healthcare providers in efforts of planning effective and equitable discharge recommendations.</AbstractText>

AB  - Lightweight or mobile neural networks used for real-time computer vision tasks contain fewer parameters than normal networks, which lead to a constrained performance. In this work, we proposed a novel activation function named Tanh Exponential Activation Function (TanhExp) which can improve the performance for these networks on image classification task significantly. The definition of TanhExp is f(x) = xtanh(e^x). We demonstrate the simplicity, efficiency, and robustness of TanhExp on various datasets and network models and TanhExp outperforms its counterparts in both convergence speed and accuracy. Its behaviour also remains stable even with noise added and dataset altered. We show that without increasing the size of the network, the capacity of lightweight neural networks can be enhanced by TanhExp with only a few training epochs and no extra parameters added.

AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>A major challenge in biotechnology and biomanufacturing is the identification of a set of biomarkers for perturbations and metabolites of interest. Here, we develop a data-driven, transcriptome-wide approach to rank perturbation-inducible genes from time-series RNA sequencing data for the discovery of analyte-responsive promoters. This provides a set of biomarkers that act as a proxy for the transcriptional state referred to as cell state. We construct low-dimensional models of gene expression dynamics and rank genes by their ability to capture the perturbation-specific cell state using a novel observability analysis. Using this ranking, we extract 15 analyte-responsive promoters for the organophosphate malathion in the underutilized host organism<jats:italic>Pseudomonas fluorescens</jats:italic>SBW25. We develop synthetic genetic reporters from each analyte-responsive promoter and characterize their response to malathion. Furthermore, we enhance malathion reporting through the aggregation of the response of individual reporters with a synthetic consortium approach, and we exemplify the library’s ability to be useful outside the lab by detecting malathion in the environment. The library of living malathion sensors can be optimized for use in environmental diagnostics while the developed machine learning tool can be applied to discover perturbation-inducible gene expression systems in the compendium of host organisms.</jats:p>

AB  - <jats:p>The CFTR gene, which encodes a protein present in the cell membranes of epithelial tissues, has an effect on a number of organ systems in the human body. Mutations in the CFTR gene lead to incorrect regulation of cell electrolytes and water levels. The importance of this gene for typical human development has been clearly stated through studies on the CFTR mutation. A new born that inherits one mutant copy of the CFTR gene from each parent may have cystic fibrosis, which is an autosomal recessive disease. This paper establishes a model for mutant genes that will assist in determining whether or not the embedded gene is mutated. Early detection enables the possibility of slightly earlier disease risk reduction. Modelling mutant genes and correspondingly matching the new gene with them would be a crucial and cost-effective method of preventing various chronic diseases and treatment resistance.&#x0D;

AB  - Crowd counting has important applications in public safety and pandemic control. A robust and practical crowd counting system has to be capable of continuously learning with the newly incoming domain data in real-world scenarios instead of fitting one domain only. Off-the-shelf methods have some drawbacks when handling multiple domains: (1) the models will achieve limited performance (even drop dramatically) among old domains after training images from new domains due to the discrepancies in intrinsic data distributions from various domains, which is called catastrophic forgetting; (2) the well-trained model in a specific domain achieves imperfect performance among other unseen domains because of domain shift; (3) it leads to linearly increasing storage overhead, either mixing all the data for training or simply training dozens of separate models for different domains when new ones are available. To overcome these issues, we investigate a new crowd counting task in incremental domain training setting called lifelong crowd counting. Its goal is to alleviate catastrophic forgetting and improve the generalization ability using a single model updated by the incremental domains. Specifically, we propose a self-distillation learning framework as a benchmark (forget less, count better, or FLCB) for lifelong crowd counting, which helps the model leverage previous meaningful knowledge in a sustainable manner for better crowd counting to mitigate the forgetting when new data arrive. A new quantitative metric, normalized Backward Transfer (nBwT), is developed to evaluate the forgetting degree of the model in the lifelong learning process. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed benchmark in achieving a low catastrophic forgetting degree and strong generalization ability.

AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is caused by an expanded CAG repeat in the huntingtin gene, yielding a Huntingtin protein with an expanded polyglutamine tract. While experiments with patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) can help understand disease, defining pathological biomarkers remains challenging. Here, we used cryogenic electron tomography to visualize neurites in HD patient iPSC-derived neurons with varying CAG repeats, and primary cortical neurons from BACHD, deltaN17-BACHD, and wild-type mice. In HD models, we discovered sheet aggregates in double membrane-bound organelles, and mitochondria with distorted cristae and enlarged granules, likely mitochondrial RNA granules. We used artificial intelligence to quantify mitochondrial granules, and proteomics experiments reveal differential protein content in isolated HD mitochondria. Knockdown of Protein Inhibitor of Activated STAT1 ameliorated aberrant phenotypes in iPSC- and BACHD neurons. We show that integrated ultrastructural and proteomic approaches may uncover early HD phenotypes to accelerate diagnostics and the development of targeted therapeutics for HD.

               <jats:p>We apply multiparty computation (MPC) techniques to show, given a database that is secret-shared among multiple mutually distrustful parties, how the parties may obliviously construct a decision tree based on the secret data. We consider data with continuous attributes (i.e., coming from a large domain), and develop a secure version of a learning algorithm similar to the C4.5 or CART algorithms. Previous MPC-based work only focused on decision tree learning with discrete attributes (De Hoogh et al. 2014). Our starting point is to apply an existing generic MPC protocol to a standard decision tree learning algorithm, which we then optimize in several ways. We exploit the fact that even if we allow the data to have continuous values, which a priori might require fixed or floating point representations, the output of the tree learning algorithm only depends on the relative ordering of the data. By obliviously sorting the data we reduce the number of comparisons needed per node to <jats:italic>O</jats:italic>(<jats:italic>N</jats:italic> log<jats:sup>2</jats:sup>
                  <jats:italic>N</jats:italic>) from the naive <jats:italic>O</jats:italic>(<jats:italic>N</jats:italic>
                  <jats:sup>2</jats:sup>), where <jats:italic>N</jats:italic> is the number of training records in the dataset, thus making the algorithm feasible for larger datasets. This does however introduce a problem when duplicate values occur in the dataset, but we manage to overcome this problem with a relatively cheap subprotocol. We show a procedure to convert a sorting network into a permutation network of smaller complexity, resulting in a round complexity of <jats:italic>O</jats:italic>(log <jats:italic>N</jats:italic>) per layer in the tree. We implement our algorithm in the MP-SPDZ framework and benchmark our implementation for both passive and active three-party computation using arithmetic modulo 2<jats:sup>64</jats:sup>. We apply our implementation to a large scale medical dataset of ≈ 290 000 rows using random forests, and thus demonstrate practical feasibility of using MPC for privacy-preserving machine learning based on decision trees for large datasets.</jats:p>

AB  - Abstract We propose an innovative approach to model the probability of interlinkages in an interbank network with the use of Machine Learning techniques. More precisely we forecast the probability of a pair of banks entering into an interbank market borrower - lender relationship considering their financial characteristics and their past observed behavior. In this framework we examine a new method that employs machine learning in order to increase the accuracy of agnostic algorithms in reconstructing a financial network. The XGBOOST method is combined with both Maximum Entropy (MAXE) and Minimum Density (ANAN). The main contribution of this paper is that we enrich the information generally available for financial networks with variables that are available for the publication of banks financial statements (ensemble method). A set of agnostic models, i.e. models that the exposure allocation algorithm does not include prior information, are used as a benchmark to measure the additional benefit for applying machine learning in estimating prior network probabilities. By comparing the results between the agnostic algorithms and the ensemble method we see an increase in the accuracy and a decrease in the MAE of the financial networks on average. Our purpose is to depart from agnostic assumptions usually employed in interbank matrix allocation algorithms and take into account the financial features of the banks when assigning prior link probabilities. Our main finding is that machine learning algorithms outperforms the benchmark Logistic Regression model in interbank link forecasting and this is also reflected in the enhanced performance when overall network similarity measures are performed.

AB  - Optimisation problems often have multiple conflicting objectives that can be computationally and/or financially expensive. Mono-surrogate Bayesian optimisation (BO) is a popular model-based approach for optimising such black-box functions. It combines objective values via scalarisation and builds a Gaussian process (GP) surrogate of the scalarised values. The location which maximises a cheap-to-query acquisition function is chosen as the next location to expensively evaluate. While BO is an effective strategy, the use of GPs is limiting. Their performance decreases as the problem input dimensionality increases, and their computational complexity scales cubically with the amount of data. To address these limitations, we extend previous work on BO by density-ratio estimation (BORE) to the multi-objective setting. BORE links the computation of the probability of improvement acquisition function to that of probabilistic classification. This enables the use of state-of-the-art classifiers in a BO-like framework. In this work we present MBORE: multi-objective Bayesian optimisation by density-ratio estimation, and compare it to BO across a range of synthetic and real-world benchmarks. We find that MBORE performs as well as or better than BO on a wide variety of problems, and that it outperforms BO on high-dimensional and real-world problems.

AB  - <jats:p>Water presents challenges in swiftly and accurately assessing its quality due to its intricate composition, diverse sources, and the emergence of new pollutants. Current research tends to oversimplify water quality, categorizing it as potable or not, despite its complexity. To address this, we developed a water quality prediction system (WaQuPs), a sophisticated solution tackling the intricacies of water quality assessment. WaQuPs employs advanced machine learning, including an ensemble learning model, categorizing water quality into nuanced levels: potable, lightly polluted, moderately polluted, and heavily polluted. To ensure rapid and precise dissemination of information, WaQuPs integrates an Internet of Things (IoT)-based communication protocol for the efficient delivery of detected water quality results. In its development, we utilized advanced techniques, such as random oversampling (ROS) for dataset balance. We used a correlation coefficient to select relevant features for the ensemble learning algorithm based on the Random Forest algorithm. Further enhancements were made through hyperparameter tuning to improve the prediction accuracy. WaQuPs exhibited impressive metrics, achieving an accuracy of 83%, precision of 82%, recall of 83%, and an F1-score of 82%. Comparative analysis revealed that WaQuPs with the Random Forest model outperformed both the XGBoost and CatBoost models, confirming its superiority in predicting water quality.</jats:p>

AB  - Recently, football has seen the creation of various novel, ubiquitous metrics used throughout clubs' analytics departments. These can influence many of their day-to-day operations ranging from financial decisions on player transfers, to evaluation of team performance. At the forefront of this scientific movement is the metric expected goals, a measure which allows analysts to quantify how likely a given shot is to result in a goal however, xG models have not until this point considered using important features, e.g., player/team ability and psychological effects, and is not widely trusted by everyone in the wider football community. This study aims to solve both these issues through the implementation of machine learning techniques by, modelling expected goals values using previously untested features and comparing the predictive ability of traditional statistics against this newly developed metric. Error values from the expected goals models built in this work were shown to be competitive with optimal values from other papers, and some of the features added in this study were revealed to have a significant impact on expected goals model outputs. Secondly, not only was expected goals found to be a superior predictor of a football team's future success when compared to traditional statistics, but also our results outperformed those collected from an industry leader in the same area.

AB  - Serotonin plays a central role in cognition and is the target of most pharmaceuticals for psychiatric disorders. Existing drugs have limited efficacy; creation of improved versions will require better understanding of serotonergic circuitry, which has been hampered by our inability to monitor serotonin release and transport with high spatial and temporal resolution. We developed and applied a binding-pocket redesign strategy, guided by machine learning, to create a high-performance, soluble, fluorescent serotonin sensor (iSeroSnFR), enabling optical detection of millisecond-scale serotonin transients. We demonstrate that iSeroSnFR can be used to detect serotonin release in freely behaving mice during fear conditioning, social interaction, and sleep/wake transitions. We also developed a robust assay of serotonin transporter function and modulation by drugs. We expect that both machine-learning-guided binding-pocket redesign and iSeroSnFR will have broad utility for the development of other sensors and in vitro and in vivo serotonin detection, respectively.

AB  - Identification of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell epitopes is critical for the development of immunotherapeutics. Existing methods for major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC class I) ligand discovery are time intensive, specialized and unable to interrogate specific proteins on a large scale. Here, we present EpiScan, which uses surface MHC class I levels as a readout for whether a genetically encoded peptide is an MHC class I ligand. Predetermined starting pools composed of >100,000 peptides can be designed using oligonucleotide synthesis, permitting large-scale MHC class I screening. We exploit this programmability of EpiScan to uncover an unappreciated role for cysteine that increases the number of predicted ligands by 9-21%, reveal affinity hierarchies by analysis of biased anchor peptide libraries and screen viral proteomes for MHC class I ligands. Using these data, we generate and iteratively refine peptide binding predictions to create EpiScan Predictor. EpiScan Predictor performs comparably to other state-of-the-art MHC class I peptide binding prediction algorithms without suffering from underrepresentation of cysteine-containing peptides. Thus, targeted immunopeptidomics using EpiScan will accelerate CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell epitope discovery toward the goal of individual-specific immunotherapeutics.

AB  - Selective breeding for production traits has yielded relatively rapid successes with high-fecundity aquaculture species. Discovering the genetic changes associated with selection is an important goal for understanding adaptation and can also facilitate better predictions about the likely fitness of selected strains if they escape aquaculture farms. Here, we hypothesize domestication as a genetic change induced by inadvertent selection in culture. Our premise is that standardized culture protocols generate parallel domestication effects across independent strains. Using eastern oyster as a model and a newly developed 600K SNP array, this study tested for parallel domestication effects in multiple independent selection lines compared with their progenitor wild populations. A single contrast was made between pooled selected strains (1-17 generations in culture) and all wild progenitor samples combined. Population structure analysis indicated rank order levels of differentiation as [wild - wild] < [wild - cultured] < [cultured - cultured]. A genome scan for parallel adaptation to the captive environment applied two methodologically distinct outlier tests to the wild versus selected strain contrast and identified a total of 1174 candidate SNPs. Contrasting wild versus selected strains revealed the early evolutionary consequences of domestication in terms of genomic differentiation, standing genetic diversity, effective population size, relatedness, runs of homozygosity profiles, and genome-wide linkage disequilibrium patterns. Random Forest was used to identify 37 outlier SNPs that had the greatest discriminatory power between bulked wild and selected oysters. The outlier SNPs were in genes enriched for cytoskeletal functions, hinting at possible traits under inadvertent selection during larval culture or pediveliger setting at high density. This study documents rapid genomic changes stemming from hatchery-based cultivation of eastern oysters, identifies candidate loci responding to domestication in parallel among independent aquaculture strains, and provides potentially useful genomic resources for monitoring interbreeding between farm and wild oysters.

          <AbstractText Label="Methods" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">Phage Immunoprecipitation-Sequencing (PhIP-seq) was employed to identify autoantibodies in the serum of patients with AIH (<i>n</i> = 115), compared to patients with other liver diseases (metabolic associated steatotic liver disease (MASH) <i>n</i> = 178, primary biliary cholangitis (PBC), <i>n</i> = 26, or healthy controls, <i>n</i> = 94).</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="Results" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">Logistic regression using PhIP-seq enriched peptides as inputs yielded a classification AUC of 0.81, indicating the presence of a predictive humoral immune signature for AIH. Embedded within this signature were disease relevant targets, including SLA/LP, the target of a well-recognized autoantibody in AIH, disco interacting protein 2 homolog A (DIP2A), and the relaxin family peptide receptor 1 (RXFP1). The autoreactive fragment of DIP2A was a 9-amino acid stretch nearly identical to the U27 protein of human herpes virus 6 (HHV-6). Fine mapping of this epitope suggests the HHV-6 U27 sequence is preferentially enriched relative to the corresponding DIP2A sequence. Antibodies against RXFP1, a receptor involved in anti-fibrotic signaling, were also highly specific to AIH. The enriched peptides are within a motif adjacent to the receptor binding domain, required for signaling and serum from AIH patients positive for anti-RFXP1 antibody was able to significantly inhibit relaxin-2 singling. Depletion of IgG from anti-RXFP1 positive serum abrogated this effect.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="Conclusions" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">These data provide evidence for a novel serological profile in AIH, including a possible functional role for anti-RXFP1, and antibodies that cross react with HHV6 U27 protein.</AbstractText>

AB  - Autoscaling methods are employed to ensure the scalability of cloud-hosted applications. The public-facing applications are prone to receive sudden workload bursts, and the existing autoscaling methods do not handle the bursty workloads gracefully. It is challenging to detect the burst online from the incoming dynamic workload traffic, and then identifying appropriate resources to address the burst without overprovisioning is even harder. In this paper, we address this challenge by investigating the appropriate method for online burst detection and then proposed a novel predictive autoscaling method to use burst detection for satisfying specific response time requirements. We compared the proposed method with multiple state-of-the-art baseline autoscaling methods under multiple realistic and synthetic bursty workloads for a benchmark application. Our experimental results show a 60.8% average decrease in response time violations as compared to the baseline method.

AB  - Transfer RNA (tRNA) modifications have emerged as critical posttranscriptional regulators of gene expression affecting diverse biological and disease processes. While there is extensive knowledge about the enzymes installing the dozens of post-transcriptional tRNA modifications - the tRNA epitranscriptome - very little is known about how metabolic, signaling, and other networks integrate to regulate tRNA modification levels. Here we took a comprehensive first step at understanding epitranscriptome regulatory networks by developing a high-throughput tRNA isolation and mass spectrometry-based modification profiling platform and applying it to a <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> transposon insertion mutant library comprising 5,746 strains. Analysis of >200,000 tRNA modification data points validated the annotations of predicted tRNA modification genes, uncovered novel tRNA-modifying enzymes, and revealed tRNA modification regulatory networks in <i>P. aeruginosa</i>. Platform adaptation for RNA-seq library preparation would complement epitranscriptome studies, while application to human cell and mouse tissue demonstrates its utility for biomarker and drug discovery and development.

AB  - <jats:p>Abstract. Bed-material sediment particle size data, particularly the median sediment particle size (D50), are critical for understanding and modeling
riverine sediment transport. However, sediment particle size observations are primarily available at individual sites. Large-scale modeling and
assessment of riverine sediment transport are limited by the lack of continuous regional maps of bed-material sediment particle size. We hence
present a map of D50 over the contiguous US in a vector format that corresponds to approximately 2.7 million river segments (i.e., flowlines) in the
National Hydrography Dataset Plus (NHDPlus) dataset. We develop the map in four steps: (1) collect and process the observed D50 data from 2577
U.S. Geological Survey stations or U.S. Army Corps of Engineers sampling locations; (2) collocate these data with the NHDPlus flowlines based on
their geographic locations, resulting in 1691 flowlines with collocated D50 values; (3) develop a predictive model using the eXtreme Gradient
Boosting (XGBoost) machine learning method based on the observed D50 data and the corresponding climate, hydrology, geology, and other attributes
retrieved from the NHDPlus dataset; and (4) estimate the D50 values for flowlines without observations using the XGBoost predictive model. We expect
this map to be useful for various purposes, such as research in large-scale river sediment transport using model- and data-driven approaches,

AB  - <jats:p>One of the ultimate goals of the learning process is the success of student learning. Using data and students' achievement with machine learning to predict the success of student learning will be a crucial contribution to everyone involved in determining appropriate strategies to help students perform. The selected 11 research articles were chosen using the inclusion criteria from 2753 articles from the IEEE Access and Science Direct database that was dated within 2019-2021 and 285 articles that were research articles. This study found that the classification machine learning algorithm was most often used in predicting the success of students' learning. Four algorithms that were used most often to predict the success of students' learning are ANN, Naïve Bayes, Logistic Regression, SVM and Decision Tree. Meanwhile, the data used in these research articles predominantly classified students' success in learning into two or three categories which are pass/fail; or fail/pass/excellent.</jats:p>

AB  - This is a review of atomic pair distribution function (PDF) analysis as applied to the study of molecular materials. The PDF method is a powerful approach to study short- and intermediate-range order in materials on the nanoscale. It may be obtained from total scattering measurements using X-rays, neutrons, or electrons, and it provides structural details when defects, disorder, or structural ambiguities obscure their elucidation directly in reciprocal space. While its uses in the study of inorganic crystals, glasses, and nanomaterials have been recently highlighted, significant progress has also been made in its application to molecular materials such as carbons, pharmaceuticals, polymers, liquids, coordination compounds, composites, and more. Here, an overview of applications toward a wide variety of molecular compounds (organic and inorganic) and systems with molecular components is presented. We then present pedagogical descriptions and tips for further implementation. Successful utilization of the method requires an interdisciplinary consolidation of material preparation, high quality scattering experimentation, data processing, model formulation, and attentive scrutiny of the results. It is hoped that this article will provide a useful reference to practitioners for PDF applications in a wide realm of molecular sciences, and help new practitioners to get started with this technique.

AB  - <jats:p>China’s power industry is a major energy consumer, with the carbon dioxide (CO2) generated by coal consumption making the power industry one of the key emission sectors. Therefore, it is crucial to explore energy conservation and emissions reduction strategies suitable for China’s current situation. Taking a typical cogeneration enterprise in North China as an example, this paper aims to establish a generalized regression prediction model for carbon emissions of coal-fired power plants, which will provide a reference for China to seek strategies for carbon peaking and carbon neutralization in the future. Firstly, in terms of the selection of influencing factors, this paper uses objective index screening methods, simulation means, and the eXtreme Gradient Boosting algorithm (XG-Boost) to analyze the feature importance of various influencing factors. It is concluded that the relevant influencing factors of the boiler feed water system have a strong correlation and characteristic importance with the carbon emissions results of coal-fired power plants. Therefore, this paper proposes to introduce these factors into the regression prediction model as auxiliary variables to more scientifically reflect the carbon emissions results of coal-fired power plants. Secondly, in the aspect of regression prediction model establishment, inspired by the sparrow’s foraging behavior and anti-predation behavior, this paper selects the sparrow search algorithm (SSA) with strong optimization ability and fast convergence speed to optimize the super parameters of the long short-term memory network algorithm (LSTM). It is proposed to use the SSA-LSTM algorithm to establish the carbon emissions regression prediction model of coal-fired power plants. The advantage of the SSA-LSTM algorithm is that it can effectively simplify the super parameter selection process of the LSTM algorithm, effectively solve the global optimization problem, prevent the model from falling into overfitting and local optimization, and make the carbon emissions regression prediction model of coal-fired power plants achieve a better fitting effect. By comparing the performance indicators of the model before and after the improvement, it is found that the regression prediction effect of the SSA-LSTM coal-fired power plant carbon emissions regression prediction model, which introduces boiler feed water influencing factors, has been effectively improved. Therefore, the model proposed in this paper can be used to conduct a comprehensive impact factor analysis and regression prediction analysis on the carbon emissions intensity of China’s coal-fired power plants, formulate targeted carbon emissions reduction countermeasures, and provide a theoretical basis for energy conservation and emissions reduction of China’s coal-fired power plants.</jats:p>

AB  - Analysis of the popular expected goals (xG) metric in soccer has determined that a (slightly) smaller number of high-quality attempts will likely yield more goals than a slew of low-quality ones. This observation has driven a change in shooting behavior. Teams are passing up on shots from outside the penalty box, in the hopes of generating a better shot closer to goal later on. This paper evaluates whether this decrease in long-distance shots is warranted. Therefore, we propose a novel generic framework to reason about decision-making in soccer by combining techniques from machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI). First, we model how a team has behaved offensively over the course of two seasons by learning a Markov Decision Process (MDP) from event stream data. Second, we use reasoning techniques arising from the AI literature on verification to each team's MDP. This allows us to reason about the efficacy of certain potential decisions by posing counterfactual questions to the MDP. Our key conclusion is that teams would score more goals if they shot more often from outside the penalty box in a small number of team-specific locations. The proposed framework can easily be extended and applied to analyze other aspects of the game.

AB  - Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most frequent endocrinological anomaly in reproductive women that causes persistent hormonal secretion disruption, leading to the formation of numerous cysts within the ovaries and serious health complications. But the real-world clinical detection technique for PCOS is very critical since the accuracy of interpretations being substantially dependent on the physician's expertise. Thus, an artificially intelligent PCOS prediction model might be a feasible additional technique to the error prone and time-consuming diagnostic technique. In this study, a modified ensemble machine learning (ML) classification approach is proposed utilizing state-of-the-art stacking technique for PCOS identification with patients' symptom data; employing five traditional ML models as base learners and then one bagging or boosting ensemble ML model as the meta-learner of the stacked model. Furthermore, three distinct types of feature selection strategies are applied to pick different sets of features with varied numbers and combinations of attributes. To evaluate and explore the dominant features necessary for predicting PCOS, the proposed technique with five variety of models and other ten types of classifiers is trained, tested and assessed utilizing different feature sets. As outcomes, the proposed stacking ensemble technique significantly enhances the accuracy in comparison to the other existing ML based techniques in case of all varieties of feature sets. However, among various models investigated to categorize PCOS and non-PCOS patients, the stacking ensemble model with 'Gradient Boosting' classifier as meta learner outperforms others with 95.7% accuracy while utilizing the top 25 features selected using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) feature selection technique.

AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>A decision support system was developed using supervised machine learning (ML) approach for optimization of calcium (Ca) additions by continuously monitoring the physical state of non-metallic inclusions (NMIs) inside low-alloyed liquid steels. In this work, two instances were considered to design the base algorithm for the proposed supervisory system: (1) Clogging of submerged entry nozzle (SEN) during continuous casting of steels due to accumulation of solid oxide non-metallic inclusions (NMIs) and (2) Ca treatment during secondary steelmaking for modification of oxide NMIs from solid to liquid state to avoid SEN clogging. At first, experimental investigations were carried out on liquid steel samples from three low-alloyed Ca-treated steel grades from the same steel family to evaluate the characteristics of solid oxide NMIs that cause SEN clogging. In the next step, data-driven models were developed using an in-house ML algorithm trained primarily with process data for calculating the value of the newly proposed dummy parameter ‘<jats:italic>Clog</jats:italic>.’ These models, after testing, were architected to develop a supervisory system based on experimental investigations and data-driven models. The objective of this proposed supervisory system was to predict the optimum quantity of Ca needed for successful modification of NMIs from solid to liquid state to avoid SEN clogging based on the forecasted ‘<jats:italic>Clog</jats:italic>’ value. Finally, industrial data from ~ 3000 heats were tested to verify the results obtained from the developed supervisory system. The results confirmed that this novel supervisory system could predict the optimum class of Ca for all studied steel grades with 95 to 98 pct accuracy. The integration of this online supervisory system in steel production is expected to minimize operators’ corrective actions in achieving realistic control of Ca additions.</jats:p>

AB  - <jats:p xml:lang="en">Epidermolysis Bullosa (EB) is a group of genetic conditions that cause fragile and blistering skin. Although there are different types of EB, which differ in severity, their signs and symptoms overlap. As a result of this disorder, patients face an unbearable burden in their lives, and their Quality of Life (QoL) is negatively affected at every life cycle stage. Nevertheless, the assessment of the quality of life of these patients is scanty.
This project aims to develop a patient-centered questionnaire to assess the QoL of EB patients. This tool will be a valid aid for clinicians to understand patients better and identify the areas that need more attention; moreover, it will allow them to follow the patients over time and evaluate the impact of any treatments.
The methodological process to develop the questionnaire consisted of two phases: firstly, a critical review of scientific literature was performed; secondly, a pseudo-Delphi study was carried out. A multidisciplinary panel (including patients, caregivers, and clinicians) actively participated in round tables to discuss the main areas of interest. Starting from this initial set of areas and through the repetition of Delphi (up to three rounds), a gradual refinement of the statements was carried out to define a list of items to be included in an easy-to-use but meaningful questionnaire. The final patient-centered questionnaire is thus able to measure the QoL beyond the physical symptoms and the clinical evolution of the disease, encompassing functional autonomy, psycho-emotional state, social relations and the working field.</jats:p>

AB  - One of the main challenges in robotics is the development of systems that can adapt to their environment and achieve autonomous behavior. Current approaches typically aim to achieve this by increasing the complexity of the centralized controller by, e.g., direct modeling of their behavior, or implementing machine learning. In contrast, we simplify the controller using a decentralized and modular approach, with the aim of finding specific requirements needed for a robust and scalable learning strategy in robots. To achieve this, we conducted experiments and simulations on a specific robotic platform assembled from identical autonomous units that continuously sense their environment and react to it. By letting each unit adapt its behavior independently using a basic Monte Carlo scheme, the assembled system is able to learn and maintain optimal behavior in a dynamic environment as long as its memory is representative of the current environment, even when incurring damage. We show that the physical connection between the units is enough to achieve learning, and no additional communication or centralized information is required. As a result, such a distributed learning approach can be easily scaled to larger assemblies, blurring the boundaries between materials and robots, paving the way for a new class of modular “robotic matter” that can autonomously learn to thrive in dynamic or unfamiliar situations, for example, encountered by soft robots or self-assembled (micro)robots in various environments spanning from the medical realm to space explorations.

AB  - <jats:p>The subject of the paper is the research of production technologies’ influence on positioning accuracy of a robotic arm. The aim was to find out whether different production technologies (additive and conventional) and the related design differences of the robotic arm affect its operational functionality. In the research, positioning accuracy of a robotic arm formed by three partial arms was specifically investigated, while the first partial arm, Arm I, was manufactured by two different technologies. On the robotic arm, the research was carried out in such a way that the first partial arm, Arm I, was being continuously changed and was available for research purposes in two variants. Each of the Arm I variants was manufactured using a different technology (additive and conventional) while, at the same time, the individual variants also differed in construction. The design differences of both variants were related to the production technology used. The measurement of positioning accuracy was performed with the use of two methods. Specifically, a contact and a non-contact method were used. The contact method was implemented on a 3D-measuring machine, RAPID, and the second contactless method was performed using an inductive sensor.</jats:p>

AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 reawakened the need to rapidly understand the molecular etiologies, pandemic potential, and prospective treatments of infectious agents. The lack of existing data on SARS-CoV-2 hampered early attempts to treat severe forms of COVID-19 during the pandemic. This study coupled existing transcriptomic data from SARS-CoV-1 lung infection animal studies with crowdsourcing statistical approaches to derive temporal meta-signatures of host responses during early viral accumulation and subsequent clearance stages. Unsupervised and supervised machine learning approaches identified top dysregulated genes and potential biomarkers (e.g., CXCL10, BEX2, and ADM). Temporal meta-signatures revealed distinct gene expression programs with biological implications to a series of host responses underlying sustained Cxcl10 expression and Stat signaling. Cell cycle switched from G1/G0 phase genes, early in infection, to a G2/M gene signature during late infection that correlated with the enrichment of DNA Damage Response and Repair genes. The SARS-CoV-1 meta-signatures were shown to closely emulate human SARS-CoV-2 host responses from emerging RNAseq, single cell and proteomics data with early monocyte-macrophage activation followed by lymphocyte proliferation. The circulatory hormone adrenomedullin was observed as maximally elevated in elderly patients that died from COVID-19. Stage-specific correlations to compounds with potential to treat COVID-19 and future coronavirus infections were in part validated by a subset of twenty-four that are in clinical trials to treat COVID-19. This study represents a roadmap to leverage existing data in the public domain to derive novel molecular and biological insights and potential treatments to emerging human pathogens.

AB  - This paper aims to produce classifiers that are not only accurate but also interpretable to decision makers. The classifiers are represented in the form of risk scores, i.e. simple linear classifiers where coefficient vectors are sparse and bounded integer vectors which are then optimised by a novel and scalable discrete particle swarm optimisation algorithm. In contrast to past studies which usually use particle swarm optimisation as a pre-processing step, the proposed algorithm incorporates particle swarm optimisation into the classification process. A penalty-based fitness function and a local search heuristic based on symmetric uncertainty are developed to efficiently identify classifiers with high classification performance and a preferred model size or complexity. Experiments with 10 benchmark datasets show that the proposed swarm-based algorithm is a strong candidate to develop effective linear classifiers. Comparisons with other interpretable machine learning algorithms that produce rule-based and tree-based classifiers also demonstrate the competitiveness of the proposed algorithm. Further analyses also confirm the interpretability of the produced classifiers. Finally, the proposed algorithm shows excellent speed-up via parallelisation, which gives it a great advantage when coping with large scale problems.

AB  - ESKAPE pathogens are responsible for complicated nosocomial infections worldwide and are often resistant to commonly used antibiotics in clinical settings. Among ESKAPE, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VREfm) and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) are two important Gram-positive pathogens for which non-antibiotic alternatives are urgently needed. We previously showed that the lipoprotein AdcA of E. faecium elicits opsonic and protective antibodies against E. faecium and E. faecalis. Prompted by our observation, reported here, that AdcA also elicits opsonic antibodies against MRSA and other clinically relevant Gram-positive pathogens, we identified the dominant epitope responsible for AdcA cross-reactive activity and designed a hyper-thermostable and multi-presenting antigen, Sc(EH)<sub>3</sub>. We demonstrate that antibodies raised against Sc(EH)<sub>3</sub> mediate opsonic killing of a wide-spectrum of Gram-positive pathogens, including VREfm and MRSA, and confer protection both in passive and active immunisation models. Our data indicate that Sc(EH)<sub>3</sub> is a promising antigen for the development of vaccines against different Gram-positive pathogens.

AB  - The exponential rise in advanced software computing and low-cost hardware has broadened the horizon for the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT), interoperable e-Healthcare systems serving varied purposes including electronic healthcare records (EHRs) and telemedicine. However, being heterogeneous and dynamic in nature, their database security remains a challenge forever. Numerous intrusion attacks including bot-attack and malware have confined major classical databases towards e-Healthcare. Despite the robustness of NoSQL over the structured query language databases, the dynamic data nature over a heterogeneous environment makes it vulnerable to intrusion attacks, especially over interoperable e-Healthcare systems. Considering these challenges, this work proposed a first of its kind semantic feature-driven NoSQL intrusion attack (NoSQL-IA) detection model for interoperable e-Healthcare systems. This work assessed the efficacy of the different semantic feature-extraction methods like Word2Vec, Continuous Bag of Words, N-Skip Gram (SKG), Count Vectorizer, TF-IDF, and GLOVE towards NoSQL-IA prediction. Subsequently, to minimize computational exhaustion, different feature selection methods including Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test (WRST), significant predictor test, principal component analysis, Select K-Best, and variance threshold feature selection algorithms were employed. To alleviate the data imbalance problem, it applied different resampling methods including upsampling, downsampling, and synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE) over the selected features. Later, Min-Max normalization was performed over the input feature vectors to alleviate any possibility of overfitting. Towards NoSQL-IA prediction, different machine learning methods like Multinomial Naïve Bayes, decision tree, logistic regression, support vector machine, k-NN, AdaBoost, Extra Tree Classifier, random forest ensemble, and XG-Boost were applied, which classified each input query as the regular query or the NoSQL-IA attack query. The depth performance assessment revealed that the use of Word2Vec features SKG in sync with VTFS feature selection and SMOTE resampling processed with the bootstrapped random forest classifier can provide the best performance in terms of high accuracy (98.86%), F-Measure (0.974), and area under the curve (AUC) (0.981), thus enabling it suitable for interoperable e-Healthcare database security.

AB  - Growing heterogeneity and configurability in HPC architectures has made auto-tuning applications and runtime parameters on these systems very complex. Users are presented with a multitude of options to configure parameters. In addition to application specific solutions, a common approach is to use general purpose search strategies, which often might not identify the best configurations or their time to convergence is a significant barrier. There is, thus, a need for a general purpose and efficient tuning approach that can be easily scaled and adapted to various tuning tasks. We propose a technique for tuning parallel code regions that is general enough to be adapted to multiple tasks. In this paper, we analyze IR-based programming models to make task-specific performance optimizations. To this end, we propose the Multimodal Graph Neural Network and Autoencoder (MGA) tuner, a multimodal deep learning based approach that adapts Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks and Denoising Autoencoders for modeling IR-based code representations that serve as separate modalities. This approach is used as part of our pipeline to model a syntax, semantics, and structure-aware IR-based code representation for tuning parallel code regions/kernels. We extensively experiment on OpenMP and OpenCL code regions/kernels obtained from PolyBench, Rodinia, STREAM, DataRaceBench, AMD SDK, NPB, NVIDIA SDK, Parboil, SHOC, LULESH, XSBench, RSBench, miniFE, miniAMR, and Quicksilver benchmarks and applications. We apply our multimodal learning techniques to the tasks of (i) optimizing the number of threads, scheduling policy and chunk size in OpenMP loops and, (ii) identifying the best device for heterogeneous device mapping of OpenCL kernels. Our experiments show that this multimodal learning based approach outperforms the state-of-the-art in almost all experiments.

AB  - <jats:p>A speaker verification system models individual speakers using different speech features to improve their robustness. However, redundant features degrade the system's performance. This paper presents Statistically Significant Duration-Independent Mel frequency Cepstral Coefficients (SSDI-MFCC) features with the Extreme Gradient Boost classifier for improving the noise-robustness of speaker models. Eight statistical descriptors are used to generate signal duration-independent features, and a statistically significant feature subset is obtained using a t-test. A redeveloped Librispeech database by adding noises from the AURORA database to simulate real-world test conditions for speaker verification is used for evaluation. The SSDI-MFCC is compared with Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Genetic Algorithm (GA). The comparative results showed average equal error rate improvements by 4.93 % and 3.48 % with the SSDI-MFCC than GA-MFCC and PCA-MFCC in clean and noisy conditions, respectively. A significant reduction in verification time is observed using SSDI-MFCC than the complete feature set.</jats:p>

AB  - Stimulated Raman Scattering Microscopy (SRS) is a powerful tool for label-free detailed recognition and investigation of the cellular and subcellular structures of living cells. Determining subcellular protein localization from the cell level of SRS images is one of the basic goals of cell biology, which can not only provide useful clues for their functions and biological processes but also help to determine the priority and select the appropriate target for drug development. However, the bottleneck in predicting subcellular protein locations of SRS cell imaging lies in modeling complicated relationships concealed beneath the original cell imaging data owing to the spectral overlap information from different protein molecules. In this work, a multiple parallel fusion network, MPFnetwork, is proposed to study the subcellular locations from SRS images. This model used a multiple parallel fusion model to construct feature representations and combined multiple nonlinear decomposing algorithms as the automated subcellular detection method. Our experimental results showed that the MPFnetwork could achieve over 0.93 dice correlation between estimated and true fractions on SRS lung cancer cell datasets. In addition, we applied the MPFnetwork method to cell images for label-free prediction of several different subcellular components simultaneously, rather than using several fluorescent labels. These results open up a new method for the time-resolved study of subcellular components in different cells, especially cancer cells.

AB  - <jats:p>The complex network framework has been successfully used to model interactions between entities in Complex Systems in the Biological Sciences such as Proteomics, Genomics, Neuroscience, and Ecology. Networks of organisms at different spatial scales and in different ecosystems have provided insights into community assembly patterns and emergent properties of ecological systems. In the present work, we investigate two questions pertaining to fish species assembly rules in US river basins, a) if morphologically similar fish species also tend to be phylogenetically closer, and b) to what extent are co-occurring species that are phylogentically close also morphologically similar? For the first question, we construct a network of Hydrologic Unit Code 8 (HUC8) regions as nodes with interaction strengths (edges) governed by the number of common species. For each of the modules of this network, which are found to be geographically separated, there is differential yet significant evidence that phylogenetic distance predicts morphological distance. For the second question, we construct and analyze nearest neighbor directed networks of species based on their morphological distances and phylogenetic distances. Through module detection on these networks and comparing the module-level mean phylogenetic distance and mean morphological distance with the number of basins of common occurrence of species in modules, we find that both phylogeny and morphology of species have significant roles in governing species co-occurrence, i.e. phylogenetically and morphologically distant species tend to co-exist more. In addition, between the two quantities (morphological distance and phylogentic distance), we find that morphological distance is a stronger determinant of species co-occurrences.</jats:p>

AB  - Spain is one of the countries most affected by COVID-19. Until May 5, 2021 there have been 3.54 million people infected and 78,399 deaths according to the Johns Hopkins Institute. This has meant that Spain is one of the countries in the world where the most restrictive measures have been adopted and which have had a strong impact on the economic, social, and mental health of citizens. One of the consequences of this pandemic is a severe increase in the strain on the healthcare system. Many of those infected had to be admitted to hospitals and even to Intensive Care Units (ICU). In this scenario, it is essential to reduce traffic accidents in order to avoid overcrowded hospitals. However, the Spanish General Directorate of Traffic highlights in several traffic reports that despite the decrease in the volume and distance of trips, the number of traffic accidents has not altered significantly and even during some periods has been higher than before the pandemic. The aim of this work is to establish if there has been a change in the driving style of drivers during the pandemic and to identify the group of people adopting a more inefficient and unsafe driving style. To this end, a study was carried out with 30 volunteers and their current driving style was compared with their driving style before the pandemic. The results show that drivers have adopted a more aggressive driving style than before the pandemic, especially women and those who have suffered anxiety due to COVID-19.

AB  - This report presents the conceptual design of a new European research infrastructure EuPRAXIA. The concept has been established over the last four years in a unique collaboration of 41 laboratories within a Horizon 2020 design study funded by the European Union. EuPRAXIA is the first European project that develops a dedicated particle accelerator research infrastructure based on novel plasma acceleration concepts and laser technology. It focuses on the development of electron accelerators and underlying technologies, their user communities, and the exploitation of existing accelerator infrastructures in Europe. EuPRAXIA has involved, amongst others, the international laser community and industry to build links and bridges with accelerator science — through realising synergies, identifying disruptive ideas, innovating, and fostering knowledge exchange. The Eu-PRAXIA project aims at the construction of an innovative electron accelerator using laser- and electron-beam-driven plasma wakefield acceleration that offers a significant reduction in size and possible savings in cost over current state-of-the-art radiofrequency-based accelerators. The foreseen electron energy range of one to five gigaelectronvolts (GeV) and its performance goals will enable versatile applications in various domains, e.g. as a compact free-electron laser (FEL), compact sources for medical imaging and positron generation, table-top test beams for particle detectors, as well as deeply penetrating X-ray and gamma-ray sources for material testing. EuPRAXIA is designed to be the required stepping stone to possible future plasma-based facilities, such as linear colliders at the high-energy physics (HEP) energy frontier. Consistent with a high-confidence approach, the project includes measures to retire risk by establishing scaled technology demonstrators. This report includes preliminary models for project implementation, cost and schedule that would allow operation of the full Eu-PRAXIA facility within 8—10 years.

AB  - <jats:p><jats:italic>Aims.</jats:italic>Traditional star-galaxy classification techniques often rely on feature estimation from catalogs, a process susceptible to introducing inaccuracies, thereby potentially jeopardizing the classification’s reliability. Certain galaxies, especially those not manifesting as extended sources, can be misclassified when their shape parameters and flux solely drive the inference. We aim to create a robust and accurate classification network for identifying stars and galaxies directly from astronomical images.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:italic>Methods.</jats:italic>The AutoSourceID-Classifier (ASID-C) algorithm developed for this work uses 32x32 pixel single filter band source cutouts generated by the previously developed AutoSourceID-Light (ASID-L) code. By leveraging convolutional neural networks (CNN) and additional information about the source position within the full-field image, ASID-C aims to accurately classify all stars and galaxies within a survey. Subsequently, we employed a modified Platt scaling calibration for the output of the CNN, ensuring that the derived probabilities were effectively calibrated, delivering precise and reliable results.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:italic>Results.</jats:italic>We show that ASID-C, trained on MeerLICHT telescope images and using the Dark Energy Camera Legacy Survey (DECaLS) morphological classification, is a robust classifier and outperforms similar codes such as SourceExtractor. To facilitate a rigorous comparison, we also trained an eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) model on tabular features extracted by SourceExtractor. While this XGBoost model approaches ASID-C in performance metrics, it does not offer the computational efficiency and reduced error propagation inherent in ASID-C’s direct image-based classification approach. ASID-C excels in low signal-to-noise ratio and crowded scenarios, potentially aiding in transient host identification and advancing deep-sky astronomy.</jats:p>

AB  - Online services depend primarily on customer feedback and communications. When this kind of input is lacking, the overall approach of the service provider can shift in unintended ways. These services rely on feedback to maintain consumer satisfaction. Online social networks are a rich source of consumer data related to services and products. Well developed methods like sentiment analysis can offer insightful analyses and aid service providers in predicting outcomes based on their reviews—which, in turn, enables decision-makers to develop effective strategic plans. However, gathering this data is more challenging on Arabic online social networks, due to the complexity of the Arabic language and its dialects. In this study, we propose an approach to sentiment analysis that combines a neutrality detector model with eXtreme Gradient Boosting and a genetic algorithm to effectively predict and analyze customers’ opinions of an e-Payment service through an Arabic social network. The proposed approach yields excellent results compared to other approaches. Feature analysis is also conducted on consumer reviews to identify influencing keywords.

AB  - <jats:p>Coronary artery disease (CAD) is a disease with high mortality and disability. By 2019, there were 197 million CAD patients in the world. Additionally, the number of disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) owing to CAD reached 182 million. It is widely known that the early and accurate diagnosis of CAD is the most efficient method to reduce the damage of CAD. In medical practice, coronary angiography is considered to be the most reliable basis for CAD diagnosis. However, unfortunately, due to the limitation of inspection equipment and expert resources, many low- and middle-income countries do not have the ability to perform coronary angiography. This has led to a large loss of life and medical burden. Therefore, many researchers expect to realize the accurate diagnosis of CAD based on conventional medical examination data with the help of machine learning and data mining technology. The goal of this study is to propose a model for early, accurate and rapid detection of CAD based on common medical test data. This model took the classical logistic regression algorithm, which is the most commonly used in medical model research as the classifier. The advantages of feature selection and feature combination of tree models were used to solve the problem of manual feature engineering in logical regression. At the same time, in order to solve the class imbalance problem in Z-Alizadeh Sani dataset, five different class balancing methods were applied to balance the dataset. In addition, according to the characteristics of the dataset, we also adopted appropriate preprocessing methods. These methods significantly improved the classification performance of logistic regression classifier in terms of accuracy, recall, precision, F1 score, specificity and AUC when used for CAD detection. The best accuracy, recall, F1 score, precision, specificity and AUC were 94.7%, 94.8%, 94.8%, 95.3%, 94.5% and 0.98, respectively. Experiments and results have confirmed that, according to common medical examination data, our proposed model can accurately identify CAD patients in the early stage of CAD. Our proposed model can be used to help clinicians make diagnostic decisions in clinical practice.</jats:p>

AB  - <jats:p>Ground-level ozone is a pollutant that is harmful to urban populations, particularly in developing countries where it is present in significant quantities. It greatly increases the risk of heart and lung diseases and harms agricultural crops. This study hypothesized that, as a secondary pollutant, ground-level ozone is amenable to 24 h forecasting based on measurements of weather conditions and primary pollutants such as nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds. We developed software to analyze hourly records of 12 air pollutants and 5 weather variables over the course of one year in Delhi, India. To determine the best predictive model, eight machine learning algorithms were tuned, trained, tested, and compared using cross-validation with hourly data for a full year. The algorithms, ranked by R2 values, were XGBoost (0.61), Random Forest (0.61), K-Nearest Neighbor Regression (0.55), Support Vector Regression (0.48), Decision Trees (0.43), AdaBoost (0.39), and linear regression (0.39). When trained by separate seasons across five years, the predictive capabilities of all models increased, with a maximum R2 of 0.75 during winter. Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory was the least accurate model for annual training, but had some of the best predictions for seasonal training. Out of five air quality index categories, the XGBoost model was able to predict the correct category 24 h in advance 90% of the time when trained with full-year data. Separated by season, winter is considerably more predictable (97.3%), followed by post-monsoon (92.8%), monsoon (90.3%), and summer (88.9%). These results show the importance of training machine learning methods with season-specific data sets and comparing a large number of methods for specific applications.</jats:p>

AB  - Celecoxib (CXB) is a Biopharmaceutical Classification System (BCS) Class II molecule with high permeability that is practically insoluble in water. Because of the poor water solubility, there is a wide range of absorption and limited bioavailability following oral administration. These unfavorable properties can be improved using dry co-milling technology, which is an industrial applicable technology. The purpose of this study was to develop and optimize CXB nanoformulations prepared by dry co-milling technology, with a quality by design approach to maintain enhanced solubility, dissolution rate, and oral bioavailability. The resulting co-milled CXB composition using povidone (PVP), mannitol (MAN) and sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS) showed the maximum solubility and dissolution rate in physiologically relevant media. Potential risk factors were determined with an Ishikawa diagram, important risk factors were selected with Plackett-Burman experimental design, and CXB compositions were optimized with Central Composite design (CCD) and Bayesian optimization (BO). Physical characterization, intrinsic dissolution rate, solubility, and stability experiments were used to evaluate the optimized co-milled CXB compositions. Dissolution and permeability studies were carried out for the resulting CXB nanoformulation. Oral pharmacokinetic studies of the CXB nanoformulation and reference product were performed in rats. The results of in vitro and in vivo studies show that the CXB nanoformulations have enhanced solubility (over 4.8-fold (8.6 ± 1.06 µg/mL vs. 1.8 ± 0.33 µg/mL) in water when compared with celecoxib pure powder), and dissolution rate (at least 85% of celecoxib is dissolved in 20 min), and improved oral pharmacokinetic profile (the relative bioavailability was 145.2%, compared to that of Celebrex<sup>®</sup>, and faster t<sub>max</sub> 3.80 ± 2.28 h vs. 6.00 ± 3.67 h, indicating a more rapid absorption rate).

AB  - We have shown that membrane-associated guanylate kinase with inverted domain structure-1 (MAGI1), a scaffold protein with six PSD95/DiscLarge/ZO-1 (PDZ) domains, is involved in the regulation of endothelial cell (EC) activation and atherogenesis in mice. In addition to causing acute respiratory disease, influenza A virus (IAV) infection plays an important role in atherogenesis and triggers acute coronary syndromes and fatal myocardial infarction. Therefore, the aim of this study is to investigate the function and regulation of MAGI1 in IAV-induced EC activation. Whereas, EC infection by IAV increases MAGI1 expression, MAGI1 depletion suppresses IAV infection, suggesting that the induction of MAGI1 may promote IAV infection. Treatment of ECs with oxidized low-density lipoprotein (OxLDL) increases MAGI1 expression and IAV infection, suggesting that MAGI1 is part of the mechanistic link between serum lipid levels and patient prognosis following IAV infection. Our microarray studies suggest that MAGI1-depleted ECs increase protein expression and signaling networks involve in interferon (IFN) production. Specifically, infection of MAGI1-null ECs with IAV upregulates expression of signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1), interferon b1 (IFNb1), myxovirus resistance protein 1 (MX1) and 2'-5'-oligoadenylate synthetase 2 (OAS2), and activate STAT5. By contrast, MAGI1 overexpression inhibits <i>Ifnb1</i> mRNA and MX1 expression, again supporting the pro-viral response mediated by MAGI1. MAGI1 depletion induces the expression of MX1 and virus suppression. The data suggests that IAV suppression by MAGI1 depletion may, in part, be due to MX1 induction. Lastly, interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) translocates to the nucleus in the absence of IRF3 phosphorylation, and IRF3 SUMOylation is abolished in MAGI1-depleted ECs. The data suggests that MAGI1 inhibits IRF3 activation by maintaining IRF3 SUMOylation. In summary, IAV infection occurs in ECs in a MAGI1 expression-dependent manner by inhibiting anti-viral responses including STATs and IRF3 activation and subsequent MX1 induction, and MAGI1 plays a role in EC activation, and in upregulating a pro-viral response. Therefore, the inhibition of MAGI1 is a potential therapeutic target for IAV-induced cardiovascular disease.

AB  - <jats:p>Quantum machine learning (QML) models based on parameterized quantum circuits are often highlighted as candidates for quantum computing&amp;apos;s near-term “killer application&amp;apos;&amp;apos;. However, the understanding of the empirical and generalization performance of these models is still in its infancy. In this paper we study how to balance between training accuracy and generalization performance (also called structural risk minimization) for two prominent QML models introduced by Havlíček et al. \cite{havlivcek:qsvm}, and Schuld and Killoran \cite{schuld:qsvm}. Firstly, using relationships to well understood classical models, we prove that two model parameters – i.e., the dimension of the sum of the images and the Frobenius norm of the observables used by the model – closely control the models&amp;apos; complexity and therefore its generalization performance. Secondly, using ideas inspired by process tomography, we prove that these model parameters also closely control the models&amp;apos; ability to capture correlations in sets of training examples. In summary, our results give rise to new options for structural risk minimization for QML models.</jats:p>

AB  - Safety and security issues for Critical Infrastructures are growing as attackers adopt drones as an attack vector flying in sensitive airspaces, such as airports, military bases, city centers, and crowded places. Despite the use of UAVs for logistics, shipping recreation activities, and commercial applications, their usage poses severe concerns to operators due to the violations and the invasions of the restricted airspaces. A cost-effective and real-time framework is needed to detect the presence of drones in such cases. In this contribution, we propose an efficient radio frequency-based detection framework called URANUS. We leverage real-time data provided by the Radio Frequency/Direction Finding system, and radars in order to detect, classify and identify drones (multi-copter and fixed-wings) invading no-drone zones. We adopt a Multilayer Perceptron neural network to identify and classify UAVs in real-time, with 90% accuracy. For the tracking task, we use a Random Forest model to predict the position of a drone with an MSE ≈ 0.29, MAE ≈ 0.04, and R2 ≈ 0.93. Furthermore, coordinate regression is performed using Universal Transverse Mercator coordinates to ensure high accuracy. Our analysis shows that URANUS is an ideal framework for identifying, classifying, and tracking UAVs that most Critical Infrastructure operators can adopt.

AB  - The purpose of the present study was to create a two-dimensional model which illustrates a landscape of shooting opportunities at goal during a competitive football match. For that purpose, we analysed exemplar attacking subphases of each team when the ball was in the last 30 m of the field. The player's positional data (x and y coordinates) and the ball were captured at 25 fps and processed to create heatmaps that illustrated the shooting opportunities that were available in the first and second half in different field areas. Moreover, the time that the shooting opportunities were available was estimated. Results show that in the observed match, most of the shooting opportunities lasted between 1 and 2 s, with only a few opportunities lasting more than 2 s. The shooting opportunities did not display a homogenous distribution over the field. The obtained heatmaps provide valuable and specific information about each team's shooting opportunities, allowing the identification of the most vulnerable areas. Additionally, the amount, duration, and location of the shooting opportunities have shown significant differences between teams. This customizable model is sensitive to the features of shooting opportunities and can be used in real-time video analysis for individual and collective performance analysis.

AB  - In this study, we employ an extensive single-season dataset of event and positional data, as well as machine learning techniques, to build an Expected Goals (xG) model for handball. The selected features of the data include distances, angles, and game context. Several algorithms were considered, and after a five-fold cross-validation and hyperparameter optimization, CatBoost emerged as the most suitable, achieving a predictive accuracy of about 70%. Our methodology integrates a data synchronization and throw detection approach, along with a comprehensive exploration of feature importance using the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) method. The findings provide insights into handball strategy and player performance, unlocking new potential for game analysis and tactical planning. Looking forward, the practical applications of this research extend to enhancing player training, refining team strategies, and offering a deeper understanding of handball dynamics.

AB  - We present a global interpretation of Higgs, diboson, and top quark production and decay measurements from the LHC in the framework of the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) at dimension six. We constrain simultaneously 36 independent directions in its parameter space, and compare the outcome of the global analysis with that from individual and two-parameter fits. Our results are obtained by means of state-of-the-art theoretical calculations for the SM and the EFT cross-sections, and account for both linear and quadratic corrections in the $1/\Lambda^2$ expansion. We demonstrate how the inclusion of NLO QCD and $\mathcal{O}\left( \Lambda^{-4}\right)$ effects is instrumental to accurately map the posterior distributions associated to the fitted Wilson coefficients. We assess the interplay and complementarity between the top quark, Higgs, and diboson measurements, deploy a variety of statistical estimators to quantify the impact of each dataset in the parameter space, and carry out fits in BSM-inspired scenarios such as the top-philic model. Our results represent a stepping stone in the ongoing program of model-independent searches at the LHC from precision measurements, and pave the way towards yet more global SMEFT interpretations extended to other high-$p_T$ processes as well as to low-energy observables.

AB  - Abstract A novel method to analyse the spatial distribution of neutrino candidates recorded with the ANTARES neutrino telescope is introduced, searching for an excess of neutrinos in a region of arbitrary size and shape from any direction in the sky. Techniques originating from the domains of machine learning, pattern recognition and image processing are used to purify the sample of neutrino candidates and for the analysis of the obtained skymap. In contrast to a dedicated search for a specific neutrino emission model, this approach is sensitive to a wide range of possible morphologies of potential sources of high-energy neutrino emission. The application of these methods to ANTARES data yields a large-scale excess with a post-trial significance of 2.5 σ . Applied to public data from IceCube in its IC40 configuration, an excess consistent with the results from ANTARES is observed with a post-trial significance of 2.1 σ .

AB  - <jats:p>Quantifying uncertainty in machine learning is important in new research areas with scarce high-quality data. In this work, we develop an explainable uncertainty quantification method for deep learning-based molecular property prediction. This method can capture aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties separately and attribute the uncertainties to atoms present in the molecule. The atom-based uncertainty method provides an extra layer of explainability to the estimated uncertainties, i.e., one can analyze individual atomic uncertainty values to diagnose the chemical component that introduces uncertainty to the prediction. Our experiments demonstrate that atomic uncertainty can detect unseen chemical structures and identify chemical species whose data are potentially associated with significant noise. Furthermore, we propose a post-hoc calibration method to refine the uncertainty quantified by ensemble models for better confidence interval estimates. This work improves uncertainty calibration and provides a framework for assessing whether and why a prediction should be considered unreliable.</jats:p>

AB  - <jats:p>Software reliability is an important aspect for evaluating the quality of a software product. In a growing global software industry of increasingly complex systems, reliability becomes crucial urging software engineers to strive toward the development of failure free software and to ensure high reliability before delivery. This positions software reliability as one of the key attributes required to achieve high quality software products. In response to this stature, software companies invest considerable resources boosting apps development into a multi-billion Rand global industry. In recent times smart devices are established as one of the most used electronic device with apps being the more popular medium for bringing a multitude of functionalities to a wide user base. However, current literature portrays a far from ideal reliability rate for apps. Despite the availability of a wide range of approaches focused on improved reliability these mostly remain cumbersome and costly to implement from a software management perspective. Hence, there is a need to investigate approaches beyond current dominant thinking that underpins reliability measurements in the mobile app development space. At the same time, Machine Learning (ML) is a recent recipient of much attention from researchers and practitioners that offers a bouquet of tools and techniques that when applied correctly could potentially improve reliability prediction. In line with the above, the overall aim of this study is to provide a ML modelling approach to assist with the reliability prediction of mobile apps. It is hoped that the findings of this study may provide a useful ML modelling approach to help developers increase the reliability rates of apps. For this study ML techniques were applied to 3 feature sets of data extracted from the Eclipse JDT core dataset. These feature sets based on software systems and their histories, include the source code metrics set, process metric sets, and a combination of both metric sets. All metric sets went through stages of data cleaning and pre-processing before they were modelled using five machine learning algorithms, namely, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, Naïve Bayes, Decision Trees and Neural Networks. During the modelling process, all the results were evaluated using ML evaluation scores to determine which ML modelling approach is most useful for reliability prediction. The results indicate that Random Forest generated better results in all cases and can be used for predicting app reliability since it predicted reliability more accurately and precisely compared to the other ML algorithms. Random Forest also achieved the highest evaluation score when it was applied to the combined metric set of data. This means that the modelling approach of applying Random Forest to a combination of source code and process metrics generated the highest prediction performance. This further implies that developers should consider these selected features within the combined metric set, as they could serve as useful indicators for predicting reliability of apps.</jats:p>

AB  - Despite the remarkable acceleration of robotic development through advanced simulation technology, robotic applications are often subject to performance reductions in real-world deployment due to the inherent discrepancy between simulation and reality, often referred to as the “sim-to-real gap". This gap arises from factors like model inaccuracies, environmental variations, and unexpected disturbances. Similarly, model discrepancies caused by system degradation over time or minor changes in the system’s configuration also hinder the effectiveness of the developed methodologies. Effectively closing these gaps is critical and remains an open challenge. This work proposes a lightweight conformal mapping framework to transfer control and planning policies from an expert teacher to a degraded less capable learner. The method leverages Schwarz-Christoffel Mapping (SCM) to geometrically map teacher control inputs into the learner’s command space, ensuring maneuver consistency. To demonstrate its generality, the framework is applied to two representative types of control and planning methods in a path-tracking task: 1) a discretized motion primitives command transfer and 2) a continuous Model Predictive Control (MPC)-based command transfer. The proposed framework is validated through extensive simulations and real-world experiments, demonstrating its effectiveness in reducing the sim-to-real gap by closely transferring teacher commands to the learner robot.

AB  - <jats:p>Machine learning (ML), a computational self-learning platform, is expected to be applied in a variety of settings. ML, on the other hand, uses a model built with a learning structure rather than traditional code that is written line by line in a continuous pattern. These models are created and equipped to determine the results of training using historical data. Scalability is a major challenge in real machine learning programs. Many ML-based technologies are essential to quickly analyze new data and create forecasts, as forecasts become meaningless after a few ticks (think real-time methods such as stock markets and clickstream data). Many machine-learning programs, on the other hand, need to be able to scale and train with gigabytes or terabytes of data during model training (As is found in the model from a web-scale image corpus). High-dimensional challenges pose new obstacles to machine learning professionals who are increasingly interested in scalability as well as algorithm quality. Against the backdrop of the current situation, this overview article on the scope of scalability in machine learning platforms collects, investigates, and analyzes the current state, aspects, and perspectives of scalability that can be added to machine learning platforms in a variety of ways to improve efficiency. The purpose is to do. Reliability when processing large amounts of data.</jats:p>

AB  - <AbstractText Label="BACKGROUND">Living kidney donors are screened pre-donation to estimate the risk of end-stage kidney disease (ESKD). We evaluate Machine Learning (ML) to predict the progression of kidney function deterioration over time using the estimated GFR (eGFR) slope as the target variable.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="METHODS">We included 238 living kidney donors who underwent donor nephrectomy. We divided the dataset based on the eGFR slope in the third follow-up year, resulting in 185 donors with an average eGFR slope and 53 donors with an accelerated declining eGFR-slope. We trained three Machine Learning-models (Random Forest [RF], Extreme Gradient Boosting [XG], Support Vector Machine [SVM]) and Logistic Regression (LR) for predictions. Predefined data subsets served for training to explore whether parameters of an ESKD risk score alone suffice or additional clinical and time-zero biopsy parameters enhance predictions. Machine learning-driven feature selection identified the best predictive parameters.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="RESULTS">None of the four models classified the eGFR slope with an AUC greater than 0.6 or an F1 score surpassing 0.41 despite training on different data subsets. Following machine learning-driven feature selection and subsequent retraining on these selected features, random forest and extreme gradient boosting outperformed other models, achieving an AUC of 0.66 and an F1 score of 0.44. After feature selection, two predictive donor attributes consistently appeared in all models: smoking-related features and glomerulitis of the Banff Lesion Score.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="CONCLUSIONS">Training machine learning-models with distinct predefined data subsets yielded unsatisfactory results. However, the efficacy of random forest and extreme gradient boosting improved when trained exclusively with machine learning-driven selected features, suggesting that the quality, rather than the quantity, of features is crucial for machine learning-model performance. This study offers insights into the application of emerging machine learning-techniques for the screening of living kidney donors.</AbstractText>

AB  - <AbstractText Label="Background" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">Food craving relates to unhealthy eating behaviors such as overeating or binge eating and is thus a promising target for digital interventions. Yet, craving varies strongly across the day and is more likely in some contexts (external, internal) than in others. Prediction of food cravings ahead of time would enable preventive interventions.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="Objective" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">The objective of this study was to investigate whether upcoming food cravings could be detected and predicted from passive smartphone sensor data (excluding geolocation information) without the need for repeated questionnaires.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="Methods" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">Momentary food craving ratings, given six times a day for 14 days by 56 participants, served as the dependent variable. Predictor variables were environmental noise, light, device movement, screen activity, notifications, and time of the day recorded from 150 to 30 min prior to these ratings.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="Results" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">Individual high vs. low craving ratings could be predicted on the test set with a mean area under the curve (AUC) of 0.78. This outperformed a baseline model trained on past craving values in 85% of participants by 14%. Yet, this AUC value is likely the upper bound and needs to be independently validated with longer data sets that allow a split into training, validation, and test sets.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="Conclusions" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">Craving states can be forecast from external and internal circumstances as these can be measured through smartphone sensors or usage patterns in most participants. This would allow for just-in-time adaptive interventions based on passive data collection and hence with minimal participant burden.</AbstractText>

AB  - In this study, a novel AI system based on deep learning methods was evaluated to determine its real-time performance of CBCT imaging diagnosis of anatomical landmarks, pathologies, clinical effectiveness, and safety when used by dentists in a clinical setting. The system consists of 5 modules: ROI-localization-module (segmentation of teeth and jaws), tooth-localization and numeration-module, periodontitis-module, caries-localization-module, and periapical-lesion-localization-module. These modules use CNN based on state-of-the-art architectures. In total, 1346 CBCT scans were used to train the modules. After annotation and model development, the AI system was tested for diagnostic capabilities of the Diagnocat AI system. 24 dentists participated in the clinical evaluation of the system. 30 CBCT scans were examined by two groups of dentists, where one group was aided by Diagnocat and the other was unaided. The results for the overall sensitivity and specificity for aided and unaided groups were calculated as an aggregate of all conditions. The sensitivity values for aided and unaided groups were 0.8537 and 0.7672 while specificity was 0.9672 and 0.9616 respectively. There was a statistically significant difference between the groups (p = 0.032). This study showed that the proposed AI system significantly improved the diagnostic capabilities of dentists.

AB  - Our purpose was to find the fastest race courses for elite Ironman<sup>®</sup> 70.3 athletes, using machine learning (ML) algorithms. We collected the data of all professional triathletes competing between 2004 and 2020 in Ironman 70.3 races held worldwide. A sample of 16,611 professional athletes originating from 97 different countries and competing in 163 different races was thus obtained. Four different ML regression models were built, with gender, country of origin, and event location considered as independent variables to predict the final race time. For all the models, gender was the most important variable in predicting finish times. Attending to the single decision tree model, the fastest race times in the Ironman<sup>®</sup> 70.3 World Championship of around ~4 h 03 min would be achieved by men from Austria, Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Switzerland, Germany, France, the United Kingdom, South Africa, Canada, and New Zealand. Considering the World Championship is the target event for most professional athletes, it is expected that training is planned so that they attain their best performance in this event.

AB  - Computer networks face vulnerability to numerous attacks, which pose significant threats to our data security and the freedom of communication. This paper introduces a novel intrusion detection technique that diverges from traditional methods by leveraging Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for both data preprocessing and feature extraction. The proposed process is based on the following steps: (1) training the data using RNNs, (2) extracting features from their hidden layers, and (3) applying various classification algorithms. This methodology offers significant advantages and greatly differs from existing intrusion detection practices. The effectiveness of our method is demonstrated through trials on the Network Security Laboratory (NSL) and Canadian Institute for Cybersecurity (CIC) 2017 datasets, where the application of RNNs for intrusion detection shows substantial practical implications. Specifically, we achieved accuracy scores of 99.6% with Decision Tree, Random Forest, and CatBoost classifiers on the NSL dataset, and 99.8% and 99.9%, respectively, on the CIC 2017 dataset. By reversing the conventional sequence of training data with RNNs and then extracting features before applying classification algorithms, our approach provides a major shift in intrusion detection methodologies. This modification in the pipeline underscores the benefits of utilizing RNNs for feature extraction and data preprocessing, meeting the critical need to safeguard data security and communication freedom against ever-evolving network threats.

AB  - Recent years have seen a growing interest in using data-driven (machine-learning) techniques for the construction of cheap surrogate models of turbulent subgrid scale stresses. These stresses display complex spatio-temporal structures, and constitute a difficult surrogate target. In this paper we propose a data-preprocessing step, in which we derive alternative subgrid scale models which are virtually exact for a user-specified set of spatially integrated quantities of interest. The unclosed component of these new subgrid scale models is of the same size as this set of integrated quantities of interest. As a result, the corresponding training data is massively reduced in size, decreasing the complexity of the subsequent surrogate construction.

AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Development of direct acting macrofilaricides for the treatment of human filariases is hampered by limitations in screening throughput imposed by the parasite life cycle. Efforts to circumvent arduous screening of adult filariae include drug repurposing and high-throughput screens that target commensal bacteria.<jats:italic>In vitro</jats:italic>adult screens typically assess single phenotypes without prior enrichment for chemicals with antifilarial potential. We developed a multivariate screen that identified dozens of compounds with submicromolar macrofilaricidal activity, achieving a hit rate of &gt;50% by leveraging abundantly accessible microfilariae. Adult assays were multiplexed to thoroughly characterize compound activity across relevant parasite fitness traits, including neuromuscular control, fecundity, metabolism, and viability. 17 compounds from a diverse chemogenomic library elicited strong effects on at least one adult trait, with differential potency against microfilariae and adults. Stage-specific drug effects may be crucial to limiting adverse events in endemic regions, and our screen identified five compounds with high potency against adults but low potency or slow-acting microfilaricidal effects, at least one of which acts through a novel mechanism. We show that the use of microfilariae in a primary screen outperforms model nematode developmental assays and virtual screening of protein structures inferred with deep-learning. These data provide new leads for drug development, and the high-content and multiplex assays set a new foundation for antifilarial discovery.</jats:p>

AB  - <jats:p>This article presents an energy-efficient method of controlling unmanned aircraft (fixed-wing UAVs), which consists of three groups of algorithms: aerial vehicle route planning, in-flight control, and algorithms to correct the preplanned flight trajectory. All algorithms shall take into account the existence of obstacles that the UAV must avoid and wind gusts in the UAV’s area of operation. Tests were carried out on the basis of the UAV mathematical model, stabilization and navigation algorithms, and Dryden turbulence model, considering the parameters of the UAV’s propulsion system. The work includes a detailed description of constructing a network of connection that is used to plan a UAV mission. It presents the algorithm for determining the actual distances between the different points in the field of action, which takes into account the existence of obstacles. The algorithm shall be based on methods for determining the flight trajectory on a hexagonal grid. It presents the developed proprietary UAV path planning algorithm based on a model from a group of algorithms of mixed integer linear problem (MILP) optimization. It presents the manner in which the pre-prepared flight path was used by UAV controllers that supervised the flight along the preset path. It details the architecture of contemporary unmanned aerial vehicles, which have embedded capability to realize autonomous missions, which require the integration of UAV systems into the route planning algorithms set out in the article. Particular attention has been paid to the planning and implementation methods of UAV missions under conditions where wind gusts are present, which support the determination of UAV flight routes to minimize the vehicle’s energy consumption. The models developed were tested within a computer architecture based on ARM processors using the hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) technique, which is commonly used to control unmanned vehicles. The presented solution makes use of two computers: FCC (flight control computer) based on a real-time operating system (RTOS) and MC (mission computer) based on Linux and integrated with the Robot Operating System (ROS). A new contribution of this work is the integration of planning and monitoring methods for the implementation of missions aimed at minimizing energy consumption of the vehicle, taking into account wind conditions.</jats:p>

AB  - In global QCD fits of parton distribution functions (PDFs), a large part of the estimated uncertainty on the PDFs originates from the choices of parametric functional forms and fitting methodology. We argue that these types of uncertainties can be underestimated with common PDF ensembles in high-stake measurements at the Large Hadron Collider and Tevatron. A fruitful approach to quantify these uncertainties is to view them as arising from sampling of allowed PDF solutions in a multidimensional parametric space. This approach applies powerful insights gained in recent statistical studies of large-scale population surveys and quasi-Monte Carlo integration methods. In particular, PDF fits may be affected by the big data paradox, which stipulates that more experimental data do not automatically raise the accuracy of PDFs---close attention to the data quality and sampling of possible PDF solutions is as essential. To test if the sampling of the PDF uncertainty of an experimental observable is truly representative of all acceptable solutions, we introduce a technique (``a hopscotch scan'') based on a combination of parameter scans and stochastic sampling. With this technique, we examine the PDF uncertainty on key LHC cross sections at 13 TeV obtained with the public NNPDF4.0 fitting code, while accounting for the likelihood distribution. We show that the uncertainties on the charm distribution at a large momentum fraction $x$ and gluon PDF at small $x$ are enlarged. In PDF ensembles obtained in the analytic minimization (Hessian) formalism, the tolerance on the PDF uncertainty must be based on sufficiently complete sampling of PDF functional forms and choices of the experiments.

AB  - Biofabrication techniques allow for the construction of biocompatible and biofunctional structures composed from biomaterials, cells and biomolecules. Bioprinting is an emerging 3D printing method which utilizes biomaterial-based mixtures with cells and other biological constituents into printable suspensions known as bioinks. Coupled with automated design protocols and based on different modes for droplet deposition, 3D bioprinters are able to fabricate hydrogel-based objects with specific architecture and geometrical properties, providing the necessary environment that promotes cell growth and directs cell differentiation towards application-related lineages. For the preparation of such bioinks, various water-soluble biomaterials have been employed, including natural and synthetic biopolymers, and inorganic materials. Bioprinted constructs are considered to be one of the most promising avenues in regenerative medicine due to their native organ biomimicry. For a successful application, the bioprinted constructs should meet particular criteria such as optimal biological response, mechanical properties similar to the target tissue, high levels of reproducibility and printing fidelity, but also increased upscaling capability. In this review, we highlight the most recent advances in bioprinting, focusing on the regeneration of various tissues including bone, cartilage, cardiovascular, neural, skin and other organs such as liver, kidney, pancreas and lungs. We discuss the rapidly developing co-culture bioprinting systems used to resemble the complexity of tissues and organs and the crosstalk between various cell populations towards regeneration. Moreover, we report on the basic physical principles governing 3D bioprinting, and the ideal bioink properties based on the biomaterials' regenerative potential. We examine and critically discuss the present status of 3D bioprinting regarding its applicability and current limitations that need to be overcome to establish it at the forefront of artificial organ production and transplantation.

AB  - This study quantitatively evaluated whether and how machine learning (ML) models built by data from controlled conditions can fit real-world conditions. This study focused on feature-based models using wearable technology from real-world data collected from young adults, so as to provide insights into the models' robustness and the specific challenges posed by diverse environmental noise. Feature-based models, particularly XGBoost and Decision Trees, demonstrated considerable resilience, maintaining higher accuracy and reliability across different noise levels. This investigation included an in-depth analysis of transfer learning, highlighting its potential and limitations in adapting models developed from standard datasets, like WESAD, to complex real-world scenarios. Moreover, this study analyzed the distributed feature importance across various physiological signals, such as electrodermal activity (EDA) and electrocardiography (ECG), considering their vulnerability to environmental factors. It was found that integrating multiple physiological data types could significantly enhance model robustness. The results underscored the need for a nuanced understanding of signal contributions to model efficacy, suggesting that feature-based models showed much promise in practical applications.

AB  - <AbstractText Label="Background" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">Liver transplantation surgery is often accompanied by massive blood loss and massive transfusion (MT), while MT can cause many serious complications related to high mortality. Therefore, there is an urgent need for a model that can predict the demand for MT to reduce the waste of blood resources and improve the prognosis of patients.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="Objective" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">To develop a model for predicting intraoperative massive blood transfusion in liver transplantation surgery based on machine learning algorithms.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="Methods" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">A total of 1,239 patients who underwent liver transplantation surgery in three large grade lll-A general hospitals of China from March 2014 to November 2021 were included and analyzed. A total of 1193 cases were randomly divided into the training set (70%) and test set (30%), and 46 cases were prospectively collected as a validation set. The outcome of this study was an intraoperative massive blood transfusion. A total of 27 candidate risk factors were collected, and recursive feature elimination (RFE) was used to select key features based on the Categorical Boosting (CatBoost) model. A total of ten machine learning models were built, among which the three best performing models and the traditional logistic regression (LR) method were prospectively verified in the validation set. The Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUROC) was used for model performance evaluation. The Shapley additive explanation value was applied to explain the complex ensemble learning models.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="Results" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">Fifteen key variables were screened out, including age, weight, hemoglobin, platelets, white blood cells count, activated partial thromboplastin time, prothrombin time, thrombin time, direct bilirubin, aspartate aminotransferase, total protein, albumin, globulin, creatinine, urea. Among all algorithms, the predictive performance of the CatBoost model (AUROC: 0.810) was the best. In the prospective validation cohort, LR performed far less well than other algorithms.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="Conclusion" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">A prediction model for massive blood transfusion in liver transplantation surgery was successfully established based on the CatBoost algorithm, and a certain degree of generalization verification is carried out in the validation set. The model may be superior to the traditional LR model and other algorithms, and it can more accurately predict the risk of massive blood transfusions and guide clinical decision-making.</AbstractText>

AB  - Data analytics and its associated applications have recently become impor-tant fields of study. The subject of concern for researchers now-a-days is a massive amount of data produced every minute and second as people con-stantly sharing thoughts, opinions about things that are associated with them. Social media info, however, is still unstructured, disseminated and hard to handle and need to be developed a strong foundation so that they can be utilized as valuable information on a particular topic. Processing such unstructured data in this area in terms of noise, co-relevance, emoticons, folksonomies and slangs is really quite challenging and therefore requires proper data pre-processing before getting the right sentiments. The dataset is extracted from Kaggle and Twitter, pre-processing performed using NLTK and Scikit-learn and features selection and extraction is done for Bag of Words (BOW), Term Frequency (TF) and Inverse Document Frequency (IDF) scheme. 
For polarity identification, we evaluated five different Machine Learning (ML) algorithms viz Multinomial Naive Bayes (MNB), Logistic Regression (LR), Decision Trees (DT), XGBoost (XGB) and Support Vector Machines (SVM). We have performed a comparative analysis of the success for these algorithms in order to decide which algorithm works best for the given data-set in terms of recall, accuracy, F1-score and precision. We assess the effects of various pre-processing techniques on two datasets; one with domain and other not. It is demonstrated that SVM classifier outperformed the other classifiers with superior evaluations of 73.12% and 94.91% for accuracy and precision respectively. It is also highlighted in this research that the selection and representation of features along with various pre-processing techniques have a positive impact on the performance of the classification.  The ultimate outcome indicates an improvement in sentiment classification and we noted that pre-processing approaches obviously suggest an improvement in the efficiency of the classifiers.

AB  - Empowered by technological progress, sports teams and bookmakers strive to understand relationships between player and team activity and match outcomes. For this purpose, the probability of an event to succeed (e.g., the probability of a goal to be scored, namely, xG for eXpected Goals) provides insightful information on team and player performance and helps statistical and machine learning approaches predict match outcomes. However, recent approaches require powerful but complex models that need more inherent interpretability for practitioners. This study uses a Bayesian generalized linear mixed-effects model to introduce a simple and interpretable xG modeling approach. The model provided similar performance when compared to the StatsBomb model (property of the StatsBomb company) using only seven variables relating to shot type and position, and surrounding opponents (AUC = 0.781 and 0.801, respectively). Pre-trained models through transfer learning are suitable for identifying teams' strengths and weaknesses using small sample sizes and enable interpretation of the model's predictions.

AB  - The microbes that live in an environment can be identified from the genomic material that is present, also referred to as the metagenome. Using Next Generation Sequencing techniques this genomic material can be obtained from the environment, resulting in a large set of sequencing reads. A proper assembly of these reads into contigs or even full genomes allows one to identify the microbial species and strains that live in the environment. Assembling a metagenome is a challenging task and can benefit from clustering the reads into species-specific bins prior to assembly. In this paper we propose OGRE, an Overlap-Graph based Read clustEring procedure for metagenomic read data. OGRE is the only method that can successfully cluster reads in species-specific bins for large metagenomic datasets without running into computation time- or memory issues.

AB  - Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) represent an emerging technology that facilitates direct communication between the brain and external devices. In recent years, numerous review articles have explored various aspects of BCIs, including their fundamental principles, technical advancements, and applications in specific domains. However, these reviews often focus on signal processing, hardware development, or limited applications such as motor rehabilitation or communication. This paper aims to offer a comprehensive review of recent electroencephalogram (EEG)-based BCI applications in the medical field across 8 critical areas, encompassing rehabilitation, daily communication, epilepsy, cerebral resuscitation, sleep, neurodegenerative diseases, anesthesiology, and emotion recognition. Moreover, the current challenges and future trends of BCIs were also discussed, including personal privacy and ethical concerns, network security vulnerabilities, safety issues, and biocompatibility.

AB  - Over the past decade, many researchers have come up with different implementations of systems for decoding covert or imagined speech from EEG (electroencephalogram). They differ from each other in several aspects, from data acquisition to machine learning algorithms, due to which, a comparison between different implementations is often difficult. This review article puts together all the relevant works published in the last decade on decoding imagined speech from EEG into a single framework. Every important aspect of designing such a system, such as selection of words to be imagined, number of electrodes to be recorded, temporal and spatial filtering, feature extraction and classifier are reviewed. This helps a researcher to compare the relative merits and demerits of the different approaches and choose the one that is most optimal. Speech being the most natural form of communication which human beings acquire even without formal education, imagined speech is an ideal choice of prompt for evoking brain activity patterns for a BCI (brain-computer interface) system, although the research on developing real-time (online) speech imagery based BCI systems is still in its infancy. Covert speech based BCI can help people with disabilities to improve their quality of life. It can also be used for covert communication in environments that do not support vocal communication. This paper also discusses some future directions, which will aid the deployment of speech imagery based BCI for practical applications, rather than only for laboratory experiments.

AB  - We present a novel algorithm to identify potential dispersed signals of new physics in the slew of published LHC results. It employs a random walk algorithm to introduce sets of new particles, dubbed “proto-models”, which are tested against simplified-model results from ATLAS and CMS (exploiting the SModelS software framework). A combinatorial algorithm identifies the set of analyses and/or signal regions that maximally violates the SM hypothesis, while remaining compatible with the entirety of LHC constraints in our database. Demonstrating our method by running over the experimental results in the SModelS database, we find as currently best-performing proto-model a top partner, a light-flavor quark partner, and a lightest neutral new particle with masses of the order of 1.2 TeV, 700 GeV and 160 GeV, respectively. The corresponding global p-value for the SM hypothesis is pglobal ≈ 0.19; by construction no look-elsewhere effect applies.

AB  - As critical components of DNA, enhancers can efficiently and specifically manipulate the spatial and temporal regulation of gene transcription. Malfunction or dysregulation of enhancers is implicated in a slew of human pathology. Therefore, identifying enhancers and their strength may provide insights into the molecular mechanisms of gene transcription and facilitate the discovery of candidate drug targets. In this paper, a new enhancer and its strength predictor, iEnhancer-GAN, is proposed based on a deep learning framework in combination with the word embedding and sequence generative adversarial net (Seq-GAN). Considering the relatively small training dataset, the Seq-GAN is designed to generate artificial sequences. Given that each functional element in DNA sequences is analogous to a "word" in linguistics, the word segmentation methods are proposed to divide DNA sequences into "words", and the skip-gram model is employed to transform the "words" into digital vectors. In view of the powerful ability to extract high-level abstraction features, a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture is constructed to perform the identification tasks, and the word vectors of DNA sequences are vertically concatenated to form the embedding matrices as the input of the CNN. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the Seq-GAN to expand the training dataset, the possibility of applying word segmentation methods to extract "words" from DNA sequences, the feasibility of implementing the skip-gram model to encode DNA sequences, and the powerful prediction ability of the CNN. Compared with other state-of-the-art methods on the training dataset and independent test dataset, the proposed method achieves a significantly improved overall performance. It is anticipated that the proposed method has a certain promotion effect on enhancer related fields.

AB  - Sheep milk production is a dynamic and multifactorial trait regulated by diverse biological mechanisms. To improve the quality and production of sheep milk, it is necessary to understand the underlying non-coding transcriptomic mechanisms. In this study, ribonucleic acid-sequencing (RNA-seq) was used to profile the expression of microRNAs (miRNAs) and circular RNAs (circRNAs) in the sheep mammary gland at three key lactation time points (perinatal period, PP; early lactation, EL; and peak lactation, PL). A total of 2,369 novel circRNAs and 272 miRNAs were profiled, of which 348, 373, and 36 differentially expressed (DE) circRNAs and 30, 34, and 7 DE miRNAs were detected in the comparison of EL vs. PP, PL vs. PP, and PL vs. EL, respectively. A series of bioinformatics analyses including functional enrichment, machine learning prediction, and competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) network analyses were conducted to identify subsets of the potential candidate miRNAs (e.g., oar_miR_148a, oar_miR_362, and oar_miR_432) and circRNAs (e.g., novel_circ_0011066, novel_circ_0010460, and novel_circ_0006589) involved in sheep mammary gland development. Taken together, this study offers a window into the dynamics of non-coding transcriptomes that occur during sheep lactation and may provide further insights into miRNA and circRNA that influence sheep mammary gland development.

          <jats:p>Multi-Robot Systems (MRS) have shown great potential in object manipulation and transportation tasks by enabling the coordinated handling of complex and large objects. This paper presents a novel hybrid caging-based approach for cooperative object transport using only two omnidirectional mobile robots equipped with soft grippers inspired by the Fin-Ray effect. The proposed system integrates a Leader-Follower feedback controller that regulates distance and angle between robots to maintain the object closure condition throughout the transport. The soft grippers enhance adaptability to object contours and allow stable manipulation with fewer robots. Extensive real-world experiments were conducted with objects of various shapes, demonstrating the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed strategy. Results show accurate trajectory tracking and object retention under both static and dynamic orientation scenarios, highlighting the potential of soft robotic integration in cooperative manipulation tasks.</jats:p>

AB  - Microsoft Office may be by far the most widely used suite for processing documents, spreadsheets, and presentations. Due to its popularity, it is continuously utilised to carry out malicious campaigns. Threat actors, exploiting the platform's dynamic features, use it to launch their attacks and penetrate millions of hosts in their campaigns. This work explores the modern landscape of malicious Microsoft Office documents, exposing the means that malware authors use. We leverage a taxonomy of the tools used to weaponise Microsoft Office documents and explore the modus operandi of malicious actors. Moreover, we generated and publicly shared a specially crafted dataset, which relies on incorporating benign and malicious documents containing many dynamic features such as VBA macros and DDE. The latter is crucial for a fair and realistic analysis, an open issue in the current state of the art. This allows us to draw safe conclusions on the malicious features and behaviour. More precisely, we extract the necessary features with an automated analysis pipeline to efficiently and accurately classify a document as benign or malicious using machine learning with an F1 score above 0.98, outperforming the current state of the art detection algorithms.

AB  - GPCRs are the target for one-third of the FDA-approved drugs, however; the development of new drug molecules targeting GPCRs is limited by the lack of mechanistic understanding of the GPCR structure-activity-function relationship. To modulate the GPCR activity with highly specific drugs and minimal side-effects, it is necessary to quantitatively describe the important structural features in the GPCR and correlate them to the activation state of GPCR. In this study, we developed 3 ML approaches to predict the conformation state of GPCR proteins. Additionally, we predict the activity level of GPCRs based on their structure. We leverage the unique advantages of each of the 3 ML approaches, interpretability of XGBoost, minimal feature engineering for 3D convolutional neural network, and graph representation of protein structure for graph neural network. By using these ML approaches, we are able to predict the activation state of GPCRs with high accuracy (91%-95%) and also predict the activation state of GPCRs with low error (MAE of 7.15-10.58). Furthermore, the interpretation of the ML approaches allows us to determine the importance of each of the features in distinguishing between the GPCRs conformations.

AB  - Energy harvesting (EH) and spectrum harvesting (SH) are two promising and useful green communication and networking mechanisms for the next-generation wireless networks. While the former techniques exploit ambient energy sources to scavenge energy, the latter exploit the unused or moderately used electromagnetic spectrum. With the advent of cyber-physical systems and the Internet-of-Things (IoT), the presence of tens of billions of low power sensor devices would soon be a reality. These small sensing devices would be present in many systems around us, such as home appliances, telecommunication devices, medical electronics, transport systems, etc. These miniaturized, low-power consuming devices may exploit EH and SH techniques for energy storage and communication. These EH-SH-enabled sensors or low-power nodes need to consume very little energy for sensing and communicating opportunistically. However, several theoretical problems and practical challenges exist in EH-SH communications. In this comprehensive survey paper, we first present the historical background of EH, and SH techniques, and their development over several decades. Specifically, we focus on EH-SH communication technologies and protocols for a wide range of systems and networks. We present a detailed survey of the various harvesting techniques and protocols from recent literature. Finally, we describe exciting open, intra-disciplinary, and inter-disciplinary challenges for further research on EH-SH communication technologies.

AB  - Ultra-marathon running - where races are held in distance-limited (50 km, 50 miles, 100 km, 100 miles, etc.), time-limited (6 h, 12 h, 24 h, 48 h, 72 h, etc.), and multi-stage races - is gaining in popularity. However, we have no knowledge of where the fastest 48-hour runners originate and where the fastest 48-hour races are held. This study tried to determine the origin of the fastest 48-hour runners and the predictor factors associated with 48-hour ultra-marathon performance, such as age, gender, event country, country of origin and race course specific characteristics. A machine learning (ML) model based on the XG Boost algorithm was built to predict running speed from the athlete´s age, gender, country of origin, where the race occurs and race course characteristic such as elevation (flat or hilly) and surface (asphalt, cement, granite, grass, gravel, sand, track, or trail). Model explainability tools were then used to investigate how each independent variable would influence the predicted result. A sample of 16,233 race records from 7,075 unique runners originating from 60 different countries and participating in races held in 36 different countries between 1980 and 2022 was analyzed. Participation was spread across many countries, with USA, France, Germany, and Australia at the top of the participants' rankings. Athletes from Japan, Israel, and Iceland achieved the fastest average running speed. The fastest races were held in Japan, France, Great Britain, Netherlands, and Egypt. The XG Boost model showed that elevation of the course (flat course) and the running surface (track) were the variables that had a larger influence on the running speed. The country of origin of the athlete and the country where the event was hold were the most important features by the SHAP analysis, yielding the broader range of model outputs. Men were ~ 0.5 km/h faster than women. Most finishers were 45-49 years old, and runners in this age group achieved the fastest running speeds. In summary, elevation of the course (flat course) and the running surface (track) were the most important variables for fast 48-hour races, whilst the country of origin of the athlete and the country where the event was hold would lead to the broadest difference in the predicted running speed range. Athletes from Japan, Israel, and Iceland achieved the fastest average running speed. The fastest races were held in Japan, France, Great Britain, Netherlands, and Egypt. Any athlete intending to achieve a personal best performance in this race format can benefit from these findings by selecting the most appropriate race course.

AB  - <jats:p>With the development of information technology in the network era and the popularization of the 5G era, UAV‐related applications are becoming more and more widely used, which is one of the essential basic technologies. Therefore, the technology has great research value and practical significance, a multiobjective detector based on support vector machine (SVM) is designed based on directional gradient histogram (HOG), and the startup method used with cross‐validation methods can improve detector performance. It makes the detector accuracy above 98% and has good resistance to the target scale. A real‐time target tracker is designed with its rotation variation and with an improved average displacement algorithm. The algorithm must manually select the target model and suggest the target model to achieve automatic acquisition of the target model. Due to the ambiguity of the target tracking state, several judgment conditions are set to determine whether the tracking has failed and whether the tracker state is correctly verified, with several similar target tracking algorithms. When the system is started, the system detects targets frame by frame. And it will locate a possible target by color segmentation and specify the target to be tracked to recommend the relevant model during the tracking process and open the tracker to determine the target tracking state frame by frame and perform target detection at each frame. Then it will find possible goals and will follow them to achieve a balance of stable and real‐time system performance, using the results of the TPD‐KCF method. The percentage of correctly tracking images can reach 98%, and the efficiency is significantly improved.</jats:p>

AB  - Establishing and illustrating a predictive and prescriptive model of playing styles that football teams adopt during matches is a key step toward describing and measuring the effectiveness of styles of play. The current study aimed to identify and measure the effectiveness of different defensive playing styles for professional football teams considering the opponent's expected goal. Event data of all 1,120 matches played in the Chinese Football Super League (CSL) from the 2016 to 2020 seasons were collected, with fifteen defense-related performance variables being extracted. The PCA model (KMO = 0.76) output eight factors that represented 7 different styles of play (factor 6 and 8 represent one style of play) and explained 85.17% of the total variance. An expected goal (xG) model was built using data related to 27,852 shots. Finally, the xG of the opponent was calculated in the multivariate regression model, outputting five factors that (<i>p</i> < 0.05) explained 41.6% of the total variance in the xG of the opponent and receiving a dangerous situation (factor 7) was the most apparent style (31.3%). Finally, the predicted model with defensive styles correlated with actual xG of the opponent at <i>r</i> = 0.62 using the 2020 season as testing data which showed that the predicted xG was correlated moderately with the actual. The result indicated that if the team strengthened the defense closed to the own goal, high intensity confrontation, and defense of goalkeeper, meanwhile making less errors and receiving less dangerous situations, the xG of the opponent would be greatly reduced.

AB  - <AbstractText Label="BACKGROUND" NlmCategory="BACKGROUND">Stroke is a highly prevalent disease that can provoke severe disability. We evaluate a predictive model based on the Minimum Basic Data Set (MBDS) compiled by the Spain Health Ministry, obtained for the period 2008-2012 for patients with ischaemic stroke in Spain, to establish the model's validity and to optimise its calibration. The MBDS is the main clinical-administrative database for hospitalisations recorded in Spain, and to our knowledge, no predictive models for stroke mortality have previously been developed using this resource. The main study aim is to perform an external validation and recalibration of the coefficients of this predictive model with respect to a chronologically later cohort.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="MATERIAL AND METHODS" NlmCategory="METHODS">External validation (testing the model on a different cohort to assess its performance) and recalibration (validation with optimisation of model coefficients) were performed using the MBDS for patients admitted for ischaemic stroke in the period 2016-2018. A cohort study was designed, in which a recalibrated model was obtained by applying the variables of the original model without their coefficients. The variables from the original model were then applied to the subsequent cohort, together with the coefficients from the initial model. The areas under the curve (AUC) of the recalibration and the external validation procedure were compared.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="RESULTS">The recalibrated model produced an AUC of 0.743 and was composed of the following variables: age (odds ratio, OR:1.073), female sex (OR:1.143), ischaemic heart disease (OR:1.192), hypertension (OR:0.719), atrial fibrillation (OR:1.414), hyperlipidaemia (OR:0.652), heart failure (OR:2.133) and posterior circulation stroke (OR: 0.755). External validation produced an AUC of 0.726.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="CONCLUSIONS" NlmCategory="CONCLUSIONS">The recalibrated clinical model thus obtained presented moderate-high discriminant ability and was generalisable to predict death for patients with ischaemic stroke. Rigorous external validation slightly decreased the AUC but confirmed the validity of the baseline model for the chronologically later cohort.</AbstractText>

AB  - Football is a very result-driven industry, with goals being rarer than in most sports, so having further parameters to judge the performance of teams and individuals is key. Expected Goals (xG) allow further insight than just a scoreline. To tackle the need for further analysis in football, this paper uses machine learning applications that are developed and applied to Football Event data. From the concept, a Binary Classification problem is created whereby a probabilistic valuation is outputted using Logistic Regression and Gradient Boosting based approaches. The model successfully predicts xGs probability values for football players based on 15,575 shots. The proposed solution utilises StatsBomb as the data provider and an industry benchmark to tune the models in the right direction. The proposed ML solution for xG is further used to tackle the age-old cliche of: 'the ball has fallen to the wrong guy there'. The development of the model is used to adjust and gain more realistic values of expected goals than the general models show. To achieve this, this paper tackles Positional Adjusted xG, splitting the training data into Forward, Midfield, and Defence with the aim of providing insight into player qualities based on their positional sub-group. Positional Adjusted xG successfully predicts and proves that more attacking players are better at accumulating xG. The highest value belonged to Forwards followed by Midfielders and Defenders. Finally, this study has further developments into Player Adjusted xG with the aim of proving that Messi is statistically at a higher efficiency level than the average footballer. This is achieved by using Messi subset samples to quantify his qualities in comparison to the average xG models finding that Messi xG performs 347 xG higher than the general model outcome.

AB  - The next-generation cellular systems, including fifth-generation cellular systems (5G), are empowered with the recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and other recent paradigms. The internet of things (IoT) and the tactile internet are paradigms that can be empowered with AI solutions and integrated with 5G systems to deliver novel services that impact the future. Machine learning technologies (ML) can understand examples of nonlinearity from the environment and are suitable for network traffic prediction. Network traffic prediction is one of the most active research areas that integrates AI with information networks. Traffic prediction is an integral approach to ensure security, reliability, and quality of service (QoS) requirements. Nowadays, it can be used in various applications, such as network monitoring, resource management, congestion control, network bandwidth allocation, network intrusion detection, etc. This paper performs time series prediction for IoT and tactile internet delays, using the k-step-ahead prediction approach with nonlinear autoregressive with external input (NARX)-enabled recurrent neural network (RNN). The ML was trained with four different training functions: Bayesian regularization backpropagation (Trainbr), Levenberg–Marquardt backpropagation (Trainlm), conjugate gradient backpropagation with Fletcher–Reeves updates (Traincgf), and the resilient backpropagation algorithm (Trainrp). The accuracy of the predicted delay was measured using three functions based on ML: mean square error (MSE), root mean square error (RMSE), and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE).

AB  - Cervical cancer has become the third most common form of cancer in the in-universe, after the widespread breast cancer. Human papillomavirus risk of infection is linked to the majority of cancer cases. Preventive care, the most expensive way of fighting cancer, can protect about 37% of cancer cases. The Pap smear examination is a standard screening procedure for the initial screening of cervical cancer. However, this manual test procedure generates many false-positive outcomes due to individual errors. Various researchers have extensively investigated machine learning (ML) methods for classifying cervical Pap cells to enhance manual testing. The random forest method is the most popular method for anticipating features from a high-dimensional cancer image dataset. However, the random forest method can get too slow and inefficient for real-time forecasts when too many decision trees are used. This research proposed an efficient feature selection and prediction model for cervical cancer datasets using Boruta analysis and SVM method to deal with this challenge. A Boruta analysis method is used. It is improved from of random forest method and mainly discovers feature subsets from the data source that are significant to assigned classification activity. The proposed model's primary aim is to determine the importance of cervical cancer screening factors for classifying high-risk patients depending on the findings. This research work analyses cervical cancer and various risk factors to help detect cervical cancer. The proposed model Boruta with SVM and various popular ML models are implemented using Python and various performance measuring parameters, i.e., accuracy, precision, <i>F</i>1-Score, and recall. However, the proposed Boruta analysis with SVM performs outstanding over existing methods.

AB  - Machine learning was used to provide data for further evaluation of potential extraction of octathiocane (S<sub>8</sub>), a commercially useful by-product, from Acid Mine Drainage (AMD) by predicting sulphate levels in an AMD water quality dataset. Individual ML regressor models, namely: Linear Regression (LR), Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO), Ridge (RD), Elastic Net (EN), K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN), Support Vector Regression (SVR), Decision Tree (DT), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Random Forest (RF), Multi-Layer Perceptron Artificial Neural Network (MLP) and Stacking Ensemble (SE-ML) combinations of these models were successfully used to predict sulphate levels. A SE-ML regressor trained on untreated AMD which stacked seven of the best-performing individual models and fed them to a LR meta-learner model was found to be the best-performing model with a Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 0.000011, Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.002617 and R<sup>2</sup> of 0.9997. Temperature (°C), Total Dissolved Solids (mg/L) and, importantly, iron (mg/L) were highly correlated to sulphate (mg/L) with iron showing a strong positive linear correlation that indicated dissolved products from pyrite oxidation. Ensemble learning (bagging, boosting and stacking) outperformed individual methods due to their combined predictive accuracies. Surprisingly, when comparing SE-ML that combined all models with SE-ML that combined only the best-performing models, there was only a slight difference in model accuracies which indicated that including bad-performing models in the stack had no adverse effect on its predictive performance.

AB  - Nonlinear optimization-based motion planning algorithms have been successfully used for dynamically feasible trajectory planning of road vehicles. However, the main drawback of these methods is their significant computational effort and thus high runtime, which makes real-time application a complex problem. Addressing this field, this paper proposes an algorithm for fast simulation of road vehicle motion based on artificial neural networks that can be used in optimization-based trajectory planners. The neural networks are trained with supervised learning techniques to predict the future state of the vehicle based on its current state and driving inputs. Learning data is provided for a wide variety of randomly generated driving scenarios by simulation of a dynamic vehicle model. The realistic random driving maneuvers are created on the basis of piecewise linear travel velocity and road curvature profiles that are used for the planning of public roads. The trained neural networks are then used in a feedback loop with several variables being calculated by additional numerical integration to provide all the outputs of the original dynamic model. The presented model can be capable of short-term vehicle motion simulation with sufficient precision while having a considerably faster runtime than the original dynamic model.

AB  - Stochastic models of biomolecular reaction networks are commonly employed in systems and synthetic biology to study the effects of stochastic fluctuations emanating from reactions involving species with low copy-numbers. For such models, the Kolmogorov's forward equation is called the chemical master equation (CME), and it is a fundamental system of linear ordinary differential equations (ODEs) that describes the evolution of the probability distribution of the random state-vector representing the copy-numbers of all the reacting species. The size of this system is given by the number of states that are accessible by the chemical system, and for most examples of interest this number is either very large or infinite. Moreover, approximations that reduce the size of the system by retaining only a finite number of important chemical states (e.g. those with non-negligible probability) result in high-dimensional ODE systems, even when the number of reacting species is small. Consequently, accurate numerical solution of the CME is very challenging, despite the linear nature of the underlying ODEs. One often resorts to estimating the solutions via computationally intensive stochastic simulations. The goal of the present paper is to develop a novel deep-learning approach for computing solution statistics of high-dimensional CMEs by reformulating the stochastic dynamics using Kolmogorov's backward equation. The proposed method leverages superior approximation properties of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) to reliably estimate expectations under the CME solution for several user-defined functions of the state-vector. This method is algorithmically based on reinforcement learning and it only requires a moderate number of stochastic simulations (in comparison to typical simulation-based approaches) to train the "policy function". This allows not just the numerical approximation of various expectations for the CME solution but also of its sensitivities with respect to all the reaction network parameters (e.g. rate constants). We provide four examples to illustrate our methodology and provide several directions for future research.

However, feature regression remains an area with room for improvement. We aim to design a network that can accurately estimate sources’ features and their uncertainties from single-band image cutouts, given the approximated locations of the sources provided by the previously developed code AutoSourceID-Light (ASID-L) or other external catalogues. This work serves as a proof of concept, showing the potential of machine learning in estimating astronomical features when trained on meticulously crafted synthetic images and subsequently applied to real astronomical data.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:italic>Methods</jats:italic>. The algorithm presented here, AutoSourceID-FeatureExtractor (ASID-FE), uses single-band cutouts of 32x32 pixels around the localised sources to estimate flux, sub-pixel centre coordinates, and their uncertainties. ASID-FE employs a two-step mean variance estimation (TS-MVE) approach to first estimate the features and then their uncertainties without the need for additional information, for example the point spread function (PSF). For this proof of concept, we generated a synthetic dataset comprising only point sources directly derived from real images, ensuring a controlled yet authentic testing environment.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:italic>Results</jats:italic>. We show that ASID-FE, trained on synthetic images derived from the MeerLICHT telescope, can predict more accurate features with respect to similar codes such as SourceExtractor and that the two-step method can estimate well-calibrated uncertainties that are better behaved compared to similar methods that use deep ensembles of simple MVE networks. Finally, we evaluate the model on real images from the MeerLICHT telescope and the<jats:italic>Zwicky</jats:italic>Transient Facility (ZTF) to test its transfer learning abilities.</jats:p>

AB  - <AbstractText Label="Background">Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the third most prevalent cause of cancer-related death, is a frequent primary liver cancer with a high rate of morbidity and mortality. T-cell depletion (TEX) is a progressive decline in T-cell function due to continuous stimulation of the TCR in the presence of sustained antigen exposure. Numerous studies have shown that TEX plays an essential role in the antitumor immune process and is significantly associated with patient prognosis. Hence, it is important to gain insight into the potential role of T cell depletion in the tumor microenvironment. The purpose of this study was to develop a trustworthy TEX-based signature using single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) and high-throughput RNA sequencing, opening up new avenues for evaluating the prognosis and immunotherapeutic response of HCC patients.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="Methods">The International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) databases were used to download RNA-seq information for HCC patients. The 10x scRNA-seq. data of HCC were downloaded from GSE166635, and UMAP was used for clustering descending, and subgroup identification. TEX-related genes were identified by gene set variance analysis (GSVA) and weighted gene correlation network analysis (WGCNA). Afterward, we established a prognostic TEX signature using LASSO-Cox analysis. External validation was performed in the ICGC cohort. Immunotherapy response was assessed by the IMvigor210, GSE78220, GSE79671, and GSE91061cohorts. In addition, differences in mutational landscape and chemotherapy sensitivity between different risk groups were investigated. Finally, the differential expression of TEX genes was verified by qRT-PCR.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="Result">11 TEX genes were thought to be highly predictive of the prognosis of HCC and substantially related to HCC prognosis.

AB  - Tropical forests provide essential ecosystem services related to human livelihoods. However, the distribution and condition of tropical forests are under significant pressure, causing shrinkage and risking biodiversity loss across the tropics. Tanzania is currently undergoing significant forest cover changes, but monitoring is limited, in part due to a lack of remote sensing knowledge, tools and methods. This study has demonstrated a comprehensive approach to creating a national-scale forest monitoring system using Earth Observation data to inform decision making, policy formulation, and combat biodiversity loss. A systematically wall-to-wall forest baseline was created for 2018 through the application of Landsat 8 imagery. The classification was developed using the extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) machine-learning algorithm, and achieved an accuracy of 89% and identified 45.76% of the country’s area to be covered with forest. Of those forested areas, 45% was found within nationally protected areas. Utilising an innovative methodology based on a forest habitat suitability analysis, the forest baseline was classified into forest types, with an overall accuracy of 85%. Woodlands (open and closed) were found to make up 79% of Tanzania’s forests. To map changes in forest extent, an automated system for downloading and processing of the Landsat imagery was used along with the XGBoost classifiers trained to define the national forest extent, where Landsat 8 scenes were individually downloaded and processed and the identified changes summarised on an annual basis. Forest loss identified for 2019 was found to be 157,204 hectares, with an overall accuracy of 82%. These forest losses within Tanzania have already triggered ecological problems and alterations in ecosystem types and species loss. Therefore, a forest monitoring system, such as the one presented in this study, will enhance conservation programmes and support efforts to save the last remnants of Tanzania’s pristine forests.

AB  - <jats:p>The major criteria that control pile foundation design is pile bearing capacity (Pu). The load bearing capacity of piles is affected by the various characteristics of soils and the involvement of multiple parameters related to both soil and foundation. In this study, a new model for predicting bearing capacity is developed using an extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) algorithm. A total of 200 driven piles static load test-based case histories were used to construct and verify the model. The developed XGBoost model results were compared to a number of commonly used algorithms—Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost), Random Forest (RF), Decision Tree (DT) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) using various performance measure metrics such as coefficient of determination, mean absolute error, root mean square error, mean absolute relative error, Nash–Sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient and relative strength ratio. Furthermore, sensitivity analysis was performed to determine the effect of input parameters on Pu. The results show that all of the developed models were capable of making accurate predictions however the XGBoost algorithm surpasses others, followed by AdaBoost, RF, DT, and SVM. The sensitivity analysis result shows that the SPT blow count along the pile shaft has the greatest effect on the Pu.</jats:p>

AB  - Evolution is full of coevolving systems characterized by complex spatio-temporal interactions that lead to intertwined processes of adaptation. Yet, how adaptation across multiple levels of temporal scales and biological complexity is achieved remains unclear. Here, we formalize how evolutionary multi-scale processing underlying adaptation constitutes a form of metacognition flowing from definitions of metaprocessing in machine learning. We show (1) how the evolution of metacognitive systems can be expected when fitness landscapes vary on multiple time scales, and (2) how multiple time scales emerge during coevolutionary processes of sufficiently complex interactions. After defining a metaprocessor as a regulator with local memory, we prove that metacognition is more energetically efficient than purely object-level cognition when selection operates at multiple timescales in evolution. Furthermore, we show that existing modeling approaches to coadaptation and coevolution-here active inference networks, predator-prey interactions, coupled genetic algorithms, and generative adversarial networks-lead to multiple emergent timescales underlying forms of metacognition. Lastly, we show how coarse-grained structures emerge naturally in any resource-limited system, providing sufficient evidence for metacognitive systems to be a prevalent and vital component of (co-)evolution. Therefore, multi-scale processing is a necessary requirement for many evolutionary scenarios, leading to de facto metacognitive evolutionary outcomes.

AB  - With the vigorous development of cloud computing, most organizations have shifted their data and applications to the cloud environment for storage, computation, and sharing purposes. During storage and data sharing across the participating entities, a malicious agent may gain access to outsourced data from the cloud environment. A malicious agent is an entity that deliberately breaches the data. This information accessed might be misused or revealed to unauthorized parties. Therefore, data protection and prediction of malicious agents have become a demanding task that needs to be addressed appropriately. To deal with this crucial and challenging issue, this paper presents a M alicious A gent I dentification-based D ata S ecurity ( MAIDS ) Model which utilizes XGBoost machine learning classification algorithm for securing data allocation and communication among different participating entities in the cloud system. The proposed model explores and computes intended multiple security parameters associated with online data communication or transactions. Correspondingly, a security-focused knowledge database is produced for developing the XGBoost Classifier-based Malicious Agent Prediction (XC-MAP) unit. Unlike the existing approaches, which only identify malicious agents after data leaks, MAIDS proactively identifies malicious agents by examining their eligibility for respective data access. In this way, the model provides a comprehensive solution to safeguard crucial data from both intentional and non-intentional breaches, by granting data to authorized agents only by evaluating the agent’s behavior and predicting the malicious agent before granting data. The performance of the proposed model is thoroughly evaluated by accomplishing extensive experiments, and the results signify that the MAIDS model predicts the malicious agents with high accuracy , precision , recall , and F1-scores up to 95.55%, 95.30%, 95.50%, and 95.20%, respectively. This enormously enhances the system’s security in terms of authorized data access accuracy up to 55.49%, precision up to 43.15%, recall up to 55.49%, and F1-score up to 39.96%, respectively, as compared to state-of-the-art work.

AB  - <jats:p>Abstract: Dealing with the class imbalance issue in the data is a big problem when creating fraud detection systems since valid transactions exceed fraudulent transactions by a large degree. Fraudulent transactions generally make up less than 1% of all transactions. This is a crucial field of research because it can be challenging to discern between a positive instance (a fraudulent case), and it gets tougher when more data are collected and a smaller percentage of such cases are represented. Eight distinct sampling techniques and two classifiers were used in this investigation, and the results of each methodology are reported. The results of this study point to favourable outcomes for sampling methods based on SMOTE. The best F1 score score obtained was with SMOTE sampling strategy on Random Forest classifier at 0.867.</jats:p>

AB  - <jats:p>Breast cancer subtype classification is a multi-class classification problem that can be handled using computational methods. Three main challenges need to be addressed. Consider first the high dimensionality of the available datasets relative to the extremely small number of instances. Second, the integration of different levels of data makes the dimensionality problem even more challenging. The third challenging issue is the ability to explain the predictions provided by a machine learning model. Recently, several deep learning models have been proposed for feature extraction and classification. However, due to the small size of the datasets, they were unable to achieve satisfactory results, particularly in multi-class classification. Aside from that, explaining the impact of features on classification has not been addressed in previous works. To cope with these problems, we propose a multi-stage feature selection (FS) framework with two data integration schemes. Using multi-omics data, four machine learning models, namely support vector machines, random forest, extra trees, and XGBoost, were investigated at each level. The SHAP framework was used to explain how specific features influenced classification. Experimental results demonstrated that ensemble models with early integration and two stage feature selection improved results compared to baseline experiments and to state-of-the art methods. Furthermore, more explanations regarding the implications of the main relevant features in the predictions are provided, which could serve as a baseline for future biological investigations.</jats:p>

The production rate is maximized for large scalar couplings, which prompts us to carefully reconsider the perturbativity constraints on the theory. This leads us to construct a new set of 140 benchmark points that have a triple Higgs boson production cross-section at least 100 times larger than the SM value.</jats:p>
          <jats:p>Furthermore, we study the dynamics of the electroweak phase transition, both analytically at leading order, and numerically without the high-temperature expansion. Both analyses indicate that a first-order phase transition is incompatible with the requirement that both singlets have a non-zero vev in the present-day vacuum, as required by doubly-enhanced triple Higgs boson production. Allowing instead one of the singlets to remain at zero field value opens up the possibility of a first-order phase transition, while di-Higgs boson production can still be enhanced by a (single) resonance.</jats:p>

AB  - This study aims to propose an original approach to the interpretability of the explanatory variables (features) in the well-known expected goals (xG) model for shot analysis in football. To do this, a new original sample of 7801 shots from Italy's Serie A (1 binary outcome and 26 features) for the 2022/2023 and 2023/2024 seasons were used, in which 8 new features of various types were introduced, integrating event data, performance data, and tracking data. Specifically, the performance of 8 statistical and machine learning (algorithmic) classifiers was compared. The focus was on two key aspects related to the field of explainable Artificial Intelligence (xAI), 'accuracy' and 'explainability', assessed using some appropriate metrics. Considering the accuracy metrics, among the statistical classifiers Binary Regression (BR) with the cloglog link function is the most effective. In contrast, among the algorithmic classifiers, xGBoost has the best performance but is slightly lower than the BR-cloglog. Regarding explainability, the primary contribution to the xG consistently comes from a small set of variables across all classifiers. The most influential features are the proximity to the goal, the shooting angle, and the shooter's visual angle.

AB  - Internet security is a major concern these days due to the increasing demand for information technology (IT)-based platforms and cloud computing. With its expansion, the Internet has been facing various types of attacks. Viruses, denial of service (DoS) attacks, distributed DoS (DDoS) attacks, code injection attacks, and spoofing are the most common types of attacks in the modern era. Due to the expansion of IT, the volume and severity of network attacks have been increasing lately. DoS and DDoS are the most frequently reported network traffic attacks. Traditional solutions such as intrusion detection systems and firewalls cannot detect complex DDoS and DoS attacks. With the integration of artificial intelligence-based machine learning and deep learning methods, several novel approaches have been presented for DoS and DDoS detection. In particular, deep learning models have played a crucial role in detecting DDoS attacks due to their exceptional performance. This study adopts deep learning models including recurrent neural network (RNN), long short-term memory (LSTM), and gradient recurrent unit (GRU) to detect DDoS attacks on the most recent dataset, CICDDoS2019, and a comparative analysis is conducted with the CICIDS2017 dataset. The comparative analysis contributes to the development of a competent and accurate method for detecting DDoS attacks with reduced execution time and complexity. The experimental results demonstrate that models perform equally well on the CICDDoS2019 dataset with an accuracy score of 0.99, but there is a difference in execution time, with GRU showing less execution time than those of RNN and LSTM.

AB  - The optimization of the Beetle readout ASIC and the performance of the software for the signal processing based on machine learning methods are presented. The Beetle readout chip was developed for the LHCb (Large Hadron Collider beauty) tracking detectors and was used in the VELO (Vertex Locator) during Run 1 and 2 of LHC data taking. The VELO, surrounding the LHC beam crossing region, was a leading part of the LHCb tracking system. The Beetle chip was used to read out the signal from silicon microstrips, integrating and amplifying it. The studies presented in this paper cover the optimization of its electronic configuration to achieve the lower power consumption footprint and the lower operational temperature of the sensors, while maintaining a good condition of the analogue response of the whole chip. The studies have shown that optimizing the operational temperature is possible and can be beneficial when the detector is highly irradiated. Even a single degree drop in silicon temperature can result in a significant reduction in the leakage current. Similar studies are being performed for the future silicon tracker, the Upstream Tracker (UT), which will start operating at LHC in 2021. It is expected that the inner part of the UT detector will suffer radiation damage similar to the most irradiated VELO sensors in Run 2. In the course of analysis we also developed a general approach for the pulse shape reconstruction using an ANN approach. This technique can be reused in case of any type of front-end readout chip.

AB  - Football's inherent volatility and low-scoring nature present unique challenges for predicting outcomes. This study investigates the efficacy of Wisdom of the Crowd in forecasting football match outcomes as well as expected goals (XG) across a Premier League season. Participants predicted team goal counts, which were then compared to actual expected goals (XG) and match results. Results across 760 team predictions reveal that while Wisdom of the Crowd accurately predicts XG on average, it overestimates 'big-6' teams and underestimates others, hinting at inherent biases. Notably, however, collective crowd predictions outperform individual estimates consistently, affirming the power of collective intelligence. Furthermore, when tested against betting odds, Wisdom of the Crowd demonstrates limited profitability, indicating its potential as a supplementary rather than sole prediction tool. These findings underscore the nuanced dynamics of football prediction and highlight the utility of collective wisdom in navigating its complexities. Overall, this study contributes insights into crowd prediction dynamics and underscores its potential in football analytics, shedding light on its implications for decision-making and understanding group behaviour in sports forecasting contexts.

AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>In many machine learning applications, the labeling of datasets is done by human experts, which is usually time-consuming in cases of large data sets. This raises the need for methods to make optimal use of the human expert by selecting model instances for which the expert opinion is of most added value. This paper introduces the problem of <jats:italic>active pairwise distance learning</jats:italic> (APDL), where the goal is to <jats:italic>actively</jats:italic> learn the pairwise distances between <jats:italic>all</jats:italic> instances. Any distance function can be used, which means that APDL techniques can e.g., be used to determine likeness between faces or similarities between users for recommender systems. Starting with an unlabeled dataset, each round an expert determines the distance between one pair of instances. Thus, there is an important choice to make each round: ‘Which combination of instances is presented to the expert?’ The objective is to accurately predict all pairwise distances, while minimizing the usage of the expert. In this research, we establish upper and lower bound approximations (including an update rule) for the pairwise distances and evaluate many domain-independent query strategies. The observations from the experiments are therefore general, and the selection strategies are ideal candidates to function as baseline in future research. We show that using the criterion <jats:italic>max degree</jats:italic> consistently ranks amongst the best strategies. By using this criterion, the pairwise distances of a new dataset can be labeled much more efficiently.</jats:p>

AB  - Brain tumor diagnosis is a complex task due to the intricate anatomy of the brain and the heterogeneity of tumors. While magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is commonly used for brain imaging, accurately detecting brain tumors remains challenging. This study aims to enhance brain tumor classification via deep transfer learning architectures using fine-tuned transfer learning, an advanced approach within artificial intelligence. Deep learning methods facilitate the analysis of high-dimensional MRI data, automating the feature extraction process crucial for precise diagnoses. In this research, several transfer learning models, including InceptionResNetV2, VGG19, Xception, and MobileNetV2, were employed to improve the accuracy of tumor detection. The dataset, sourced from Kaggle, contains tumor and non-tumor images. To mitigate class imbalance, image augmentation techniques were applied. The models were pre-trained on extensive datasets and fine-tuned to recognize specific features in MRI brain images, allowing for improved classification of tumor versus non-tumor images. The experimental results show that the Xception model outperformed other architectures, achieving an accuracy of 96.11%. This result underscores its capability in high-precision brain tumor detection. The study concludes that fine-tuned deep transfer learning architectures, particularly Xception, significantly improve the accuracy and efficiency of brain tumor diagnosis. These findings demonstrate the potential of using advanced AI models to support clinical decision making, leading to more reliable diagnoses and improved patient outcomes.

                     </jats:title><jats:p>Jets and their substructure play a central role in many analyses at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). To improve the precision of measurements, as well as to enable measurement of jet substructure at increasingly small angular scales, tracking information is often used due to its superior angular resolution and robustness to pile-up. Calculations of track-based observables involve non-perturbative track functions, that absorb infrared divergences in perturbative calculations and describe the transition to charged hadrons. The infrared divergences are directly related to the renormalization group evolution (RGE), and can be systematically computed in perturbation theory. Unlike the standard DGLAP evolution, the RGE of the track functions is non-linear, encoding correlations in the fragmentation process. We compute the next-to-leading order (NLO) evolution of the track functions, which involves in its kernel the full 1 → 3 splitting function. We discuss in detail how we implement the evolution equation numerically, and illustrate the size of the NLO corrections. We also show that our equation can be viewed as a master equation for collinear evolution at NLO, by illustrating that by integrating out specific terms, one can derive the evolution for any <jats:italic>N</jats:italic> -hadron fragmentation function. Our results provide a crucial ingredient for obtaining track-based predictions for generic measurements at the LHC, and for improving the description of the collinear dynamics of jets.</jats:p>

AB  - The blast furnace is a highly energy-intensive, highly polluting, and extremely complex reactor in the ironmaking process. Soft sensors are a key technology for predicting molten iron quality indices reflecting blast furnace energy consumption and operation stability, and play an important role in saving energy, reducing emissions, improving product quality, and producing economic benefits. With the advancement of the Internet of Things, big data, and artificial intelligence, data-driven soft sensors in blast furnace ironmaking processes have attracted increasing attention from researchers, but there has been no systematic review of the data-driven soft sensors in the blast furnace ironmaking process. This review covers the state-of-the-art studies of data-driven soft sensors technologies in the blast furnace ironmaking process. Specifically, we first conduct a comprehensive overview of various data-driven soft sensor modeling methods (multiscale methods, adaptive methods, deep learning, etc.) used in blast furnace ironmaking. Second, the important applications of data-driven soft sensors in blast furnace ironmaking (silicon content, molten iron temperature, gas utilization rate, etc.) are classified. Finally, the potential challenges and future development trends of data-driven soft sensors in blast furnace ironmaking applications are discussed, including digital twin, multi-source data fusion, and carbon peaking and carbon neutrality.

AB  - While large language models (LLMs), such as GPT-3, appear to be robust and general, their reasoning ability is not at a level to compete with the best models trained for specific natural language reasoning problems. In this study, we observe that a large language model can serve as a highly effective few-shot semantic parser. It can convert natural language sentences into a logical form that serves as input for answer set programs, a logic-based declarative knowledge representation formalism. The combination results in a robust and general system that can handle multiple question-answering tasks without requiring retraining for each new task. It only needs a few examples to guide the LLM’s adaptation to a specific task, along with reusable ASP knowledge modules that can be applied to multiple tasks. We demonstrate that this method achieves state-of-the-art performance on several NLP benchmarks, including bAbI, StepGame, CLUTRR, and gSCAN. Additionally, it successfully tackles robot planning tasks that an LLM alone fails to solve.

AB  - Ptychography is a lensless imaging method that allows for wavefront sensing and phase-sensitive microscopy from a set of diffraction patterns. Recently, it has been shown that the optimization task in ptychography can be achieved via automatic differentiation (AD). Here, we propose an open-access AD-based framework implemented with TensorFlow, a popular machine learning library. Using simulations, we show that our AD-based framework performs comparably to a state-of-the-art implementation of the momentum-accelerated ptychographic iterative engine (mPIE) in terms of reconstruction speed and quality. AD-based approaches provide great flexibility, as we demonstrate by setting the reconstruction distance as a trainable parameter. Lastly, we experimentally demonstrate that our framework faithfully reconstructs a biological specimen.

AB  - Background This paper describes research into two pedagogical approaches to foster transdisciplinarity in a graduate engineering course that involves education and computer science. Leveraging the Communities of Practice framework, we examine how students majoring in computer science can integrate new knowledge from education and computer science to engage in an educational data mining project. The first course iteration sought to connect students from education and computer science disciplines through a blend of problem-based learning and traditional lectures. The second course iteration involved computer science students only, but included two instructors, one from computer science and the other from education. To evaluate these approaches, we conducted multiple student interviews and classroom observations. Results We found that pursuing interdisciplinary through student brokers had a localized student impact on discipline integration without creating an entire class transdisciplinary environment, proving particularly effective for students with backgrounds outside of computer science. However, it fell short of achieving an overarching integration of education knowledge across the entire class. In contrast, the co-teaching approach influenced class dynamics significantly as instructors honed their brokerage skills and introduced crucial components to the multidisciplinary toolkit. Students reinterpreted these elements within the context of their projects, leading to a deeper integration of education and computer science disciplines. However, while students did acquire more knowledge from both disciplines, they did not always achieve a comprehensive practical understanding of the class outcomes. Conclusions Findings suggest that differences in instructional design can significantly impact how interdisciplinary integration forms within a class. Using CoP, we identified various models to foster disciplinary integration. The two pedagogical approaches used—student brokers and co-instructors—achieved some disciplinary integration, highlighting multidisciplinary, interdisciplinary, and transdisciplinary integration. Engaging in projects with multidisciplinary teams allows students to interact one-on-one while working on real projects, enabling them to negotiate their participation with peers and resulting in a deeper integration of the involved disciplines. This paper discusses the merits and the drawbacks of employing both approaches to build an interdisciplinary class.

AB  - Machine learning (ML) models are used in clinical metabolomics studies most notably for biomarker discoveries, to identify metabolites that discriminate between a case and control group. To improve understanding of the underlying biomedical problem and to bolster confidence in these discoveries, model interpretability is germane. In metabolomics, partial least square discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) and its variants are widely used, partly due to the model's interpretability with the Variable Influence in Projection (VIP) scores, a global interpretable method. Herein, Tree-based Shapley Additive explanations (SHAP), an interpretable ML method grounded in game theory, was used to explain ML models with local explanation properties. In this study, ML experiments (binary classification) were conducted for three published metabolomics datasets using PLS-DA, random forests, gradient boosting, and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost). Using one of the datasets, PLS-DA model was explained using VIP scores, while one of the best-performing models, a random forest model, was interpreted using Tree SHAP. The results show that SHAP has a more explanation depth than PLS-DA's VIP, making it a powerful method for rationalizing machine learning predictions from metabolomics studies.

AB  - There has been a growing interconnection across the world owing to various multimedia applications and services. Fixed wireless access (FWA) is an attractive wireless solution for delivering multimedia services to different homes. With the fifth-generation (5G) and beyond mobile networks, the FWA performance can be enhanced significantly. However, their implementation will present different challenges on the transport network due to the incessant increase in the number of required cell-sites and the subsequent increase in the per-site requirements. This paper presents a comprehensive tutorial on the enabling technologies, design considerations, requirements, and prospects of broadband schemes. Furthermore, the related technical challenges of FWA are reviewed, and we proffer potential solutions to address them. Besides, we review various transport network options that can be employed for FWA deployment. In this regard, we offer an in-depth discussion on their related requirements for different use cases. Moreover, we give an insight into the 3GPP RAN functional split implementations and implications on the 5G FWA transport network solutions. The concepts of virtualized RANs for attending flexibly to the dynamic nature of different use cases are also presented.

AB  - <AbstractText>Bipolar disorders are chronic psychiatric conditions characterized by recurrent episodes of mania and depression. Affecting over 1% of the global population, these disorders contribute significantly to disability and mortality, often due to suicide and cardiovascular disease. Diagnostic challenges arise from symptom overlap with unipolar depression, frequently leading to delays. Bipolar disorders are driven by complex genetic, neurobiological, and environmental factors and are commonly accompanied by psychiatric and medical comorbidities, further complicating diagnosis and treatment. Standard management strategies include mood stabilizers, antipsychotics, and selective use of antidepressants, complemented by psychosocial interventions like cognitive-behavioral therapy and psychoeducation, which are vital for relapse prevention. Despite recent advancements, the management of bipolar disorders remains challenging, constrained by clinical variability, an absence of specific biomarkers, and differences in approved treatments and treatment guidelines across regions. Emerging research underscores the potential of precision psychiatry and digital health tools to enhance diagnosis and treatment. Nonetheless, critical gaps persist, particularly in implementing equitable care worldwide. This review offers a comprehensive update on bipolar disorders, examining clinical presentation, early diagnosis, pathogenesis, therapeutic strategies, and future perspectives to guide clinicians and researchers in addressing these ongoing challenges in research and clinical practice.</AbstractText>

AB  - Multimedia services are among the most developed segments of services. User behavior is changing with a significant number being very active. They utilize services that produce large amounts of data traffic in uplinks. Consequently, this is quite a new phenomenon that service providers should consider. The Quality of Service (QoS) of real-time multimedia services is crucial for all users, and research has been devoted to satisfying these requirements. Although fulfilling the QoS requirements is challenging, most of the research has focused on the downlink. The goal of this study was to focus on uplinks because this direction is crucial to modern attractive multimedia services such as streaming of videos and video gaming. This study proposed a solution that prioritizes traffic at the end of the user terminal and fixes the issue with real-time multimedia services. This effectively eliminates the first bottleneck in the entire system, regardless of the access network. The investigated solution is independent of the type of access network because it is implemented at the user terminal.

        <p><bold>Background: </bold>This study examined the social synchronization in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) when responding to others’ joint attention. Social synchronization refers to an individuals’ temporal coordination during social interactions, which has been found to play a crucial role in social development. Deficient joint attention has been repeatedly found in individuals with autism spectrum disorder, and previous studies have demonstrated various explanations about it. In a more recent perspective, joint attention could be associated with spontaneous social motor synchronization, and it is possible to explore social synchronization as a pathway to understanding the impairments of joint attention in children with ASD.<bold>Methods:</bold> Forty-one children aged 5 to 8 with ASD and 43 age-matched typically developing (TD) children watched a video to completed the response to joint attention (RJA) tasks, during which their gaze data were collected. The synchronization of gaze-shift behaviors between children and the female model in the video was measured with the cross-recurrence quantification analysis (CRQA). <bold>Results: </bold>We found that children with ASD had the ability, to some extent, to synchronize their gaze shifts with the female model in the video during RJA tasks. However, compared to the TD children, children with ASD displayed lower levels of synchronization and longer latency in this synchronized behavior. <bold>Limitations:</bold> The RJA task in our study was not a real social interaction task but rather a one-way interaction. Social interaction between two persons through live video or a natural scenario should be further explored. Besides, additional work is necessary to determine whether our findings generalize to individuals across the full autism spectrum. <bold>Conclusion: </bold>These findings provide a new avenue to deepen our understanding of the impairments of joint attention in children with ASD. Notably, the analytic method can be further applied to explore the social synchronization of numerous other social interactive behaviors in ASD. Additionally, the impairment of social synchronization may be a new implicit indicator for the evaluation of autism and can be utilized to screen children with ASD along with other indicators.</p>

AB  - The conditional gradient method (CGM) is widely used in large-scale sparse convex optimization, having a low per iteration computational cost for structured sparse regularizers and a greedy approach for collecting nonzeros. We explore the sparsity acquiring properties of a general penalized CGM (P-CGM) for convex regularizers and a reweighted penalized CGM (RP-CGM) for nonconvex regularizers, replacing the usual convex constraints with gauge-inspired penalties. This generalization does not increase the per-iteration complexity noticeably. Without assuming bounded iterates or using line search, we show O(1/t) convergence of the gap of each subproblem, which measures distance to a stationary point. We couple this with a screening rule which is safe in the convex case, converging to the true support at a rate O(1/(δ 2 )) where δ ≥ 0 measures how close the problem is to degeneracy. In the nonconvex case the screening rule converges to the true support in a finite number of iterations, but is not necessarily safe in the intermediate iterates. In our experiments, we verify the consistency of the method and adjust the aggressiveness of the screening rule by tuning the concavity of the regularizer.

AB  - Most existing sensor-based monitoring frameworks presume that a large available labeled dataset is processed to train accurate detection models. However, in settings where personalization is necessary at deployment time to fine-tune the model, a person-specific dataset needs to be collected online by interacting with the users. Optimizing the collection of labels in such phase is instrumental to impose a tolerable burden on the users while maximizing personal improvement. In this paper, we consider a fine-grain stress detection problem based on wearable sensors targeting everyday settings, and propose a novel context-aware active learning strategy capable of jointly maximizing the meaningfulness of the signal samples we request the user to label and the response rate. We develop a multilayered sensor-edge-cloud platform to periodically capture physiological signals and process them in real-time, as well as to collect labels and retrain the detection model. We collect a large dataset and show that the context-aware active learning technique we propose achieves a desirable detection performance using 88\% and 32\% fewer queries from users compared to a randomized strategy and a traditional active learning strategy, respectively.

AB  - <AbstractText Label="Background" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">The association of near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) with various outcomes after pediatric cardiac surgery has been studied extensively. However, the role of NIRS in the prediction of cardiac arrest (CA) in children with heart disease has yet to be evaluated. We sought to determine if a model utilizing regional cerebral oximetry (rSO2c) and somatic oximetry (rSO2s) could predict CA in children admitted to a single-center pediatric cardiac intensive care unit (CICU).</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="Methods" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">We retrospectively reviewed 160 index CA events for patients admitted to our pediatric CICU between November 2010 and January 2019. We selected 711 control patients who did not have a cardiac arrest. Hourly data was collected from the electronic health record (EHR). We previously created a machine-learning algorithm to predict the risk of CA using EHR data. Univariable analysis was done on these variables, which we then used to create a multivariable logistic regression model. The outputs from the model were presented by odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI).</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="Results" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">We created a multivariable model to evaluate the association of CA using five variables: arterial saturation (SpO2)- rSO2c difference, SpO2-rSO2s difference, heart rate, diastolic blood pressure, and vasoactive inotrope score. While the SpO2-rSO2c difference was not a significant contributor to the multivariable model, the SpO2-rSO2s difference was. The average SpO2-rSO2s difference cutoff with the best prognostic accuracy for CA was 29% [CI 26-31%]. In the multivariable model, a 10% increase in the SpO2-rSO2s difference was independently associated with increased odds of CA [OR 1.40 (1.18, 1.67), <i>P</i> &lt; 0.001] at 1 h before CA. Our model predicted CA with an AUROC of 0.83 at 1 h before CA.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="Conclusion" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">In this single-center case-control study of children admitted to a pediatric CICU, we created a multivariable model utilizing hourly data from the EHR to predict CA. At 1 h before the event, for every 10% increase in the SpO2-rSO2s difference, the odds of cardiac arrest increased by 40%. These findings are important as the field explores ways to capitalize on the wealth of data at our disposal to improve patient care.</AbstractText>

AB  - A standard practice in statistical hypothesis testing is to mention the <i>P</i>-value alongside the accept/reject decision. We show the advantages of mentioning an e-value instead. With <i>P</i>-values, it is not clear how to use an extreme observation (e.g. [Formula: see text]) for getting better frequentist decisions. With e-values it is straightforward, since they provide Type-I risk control in a generalized Neyman-Pearson setting with the decision task (a general loss function) determined post hoc, after observation of the data-thereby providing a handle on "roving [Formula: see text]'s." When Type-II risks are taken into consideration, the only admissible decision rules in the post hoc setting turn out to be e-value-based. Similarly, if the loss incurred when specifying a faulty confidence interval is not fixed in advance, standard confidence intervals and distributions may fail, whereas e-confidence sets and e-posteriors still provide valid risk guarantees. Sufficiently powerful e-values have by now been developed for a range of classical testing problems. We discuss the main challenges for wider development and deployment.

AB  - <jats:p>Abstract. The Cape Verde Atmospheric Observatory (CVAO), which is influenced by both marine and desert dust air masses, has been used for long-term measurements of different properties of the atmospheric aerosol from 2008 to 2017. These properties include particle number size distributions (PNSD), light-absorbing carbon (LAC) and concentrations of cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) together with their hygroscopicity. Here we summarize the results obtained for these properties and use an unsupervised machine learning algorithm for the classification of aerosol types. Five types of aerosols, i.e., marine, freshly formed, mixture, moderate dust and heavy dust, were classified. Air masses during marine periods are from the Atlantic Ocean and during dust periods are from the Sahara Desert. Heavy dust was more frequently present during wintertime, whereas the clean marine periods were more frequently present during springtime. It was observed that during the dust periods CCN number concentrations at a supersaturation of 0.30 % were roughly 2.5 times higher than during marine periods, but the hygroscopicity (κ) of particles in the size range from ∼ 30 to ∼ 175 nm during marine and dust periods were comparable. The long-term data presented here, together with the aerosol classification, can be used as a basis to improve our understanding of annual cycles of the atmospheric aerosol in the eastern tropical Atlantic Ocean and on aerosol-cloud interactions and it can be used as a basis for driving, evaluating and constraining atmospheric model simulations.

AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>The Mass Unspecific Supervised Tagging (MUST) method has proven to be successful in implementing generic jet taggers capable of discriminating various signals over a wide range of jet masses. We implement the MUST concept by using eXtreme Gradient Boosting () classifiers instead of neural networks (NNs) as previously done. We build both fully-generic and specific multi-pronged taggers, to identify 2, 3, and/or 4-pronged signals from SM QCD background. We show that -based taggers are not only easier to optimize and much faster than those based in NNs, but also show quite similar performance, even when testing with signals not used in training. Therefore, they provide a quite efficient alternative machine-learning implementation for generic jet taggers.</jats:p>

AB  - State-of-the-art healthcare technologies are incorporating advanced Artificial Intelligence (AI) models, allowing for rapid and easy disease diagnosis. However, most AI models are considered "black boxes," because there is no explanation for the decisions made by these models. Users may find it challenging to comprehend and interpret the results. Explainable AI (XAI) can explain the machine learning (ML) outputs and contribution of features in disease prediction models. Electroencephalography (EEG) is a potential predictive tool for understanding cortical impairment caused by an ischemic stroke and can be utilized for acute stroke prediction, neurologic prognosis, and post-stroke treatment. This study aims to utilize ML models to classify the ischemic stroke group and the healthy control group for acute stroke prediction in active states. Moreover, XAI tools (Eli5 and LIME) were utilized to explain the behavior of the model and determine the significant features that contribute to stroke prediction models. In this work, we studied 48 patients admitted to a hospital with acute ischemic stroke and 75 healthy adults who had no history of identified other neurological illnesses. EEG was obtained within three months following the onset of ischemic stroke symptoms using frontal, central, temporal, and occipital cortical electrodes (Fz, C1, T7, Oz). EEG data were collected in an active state (walking, working, and reading tasks). In the results of the ML approach, the Adaptive Gradient Boosting models showed around 80% accuracy for the classification of the control group and the stroke group. Eli5 and LIME were utilized to explain the behavior of the stroke prediction model and interpret the model locally around the prediction. The Eli5 and LIME interpretable models emphasized the spectral delta and theta features as local contributors to stroke prediction. From the findings of this explainable AI research, it is expected that the stroke-prediction XAI model will help with post-stroke treatment and recovery, as well as help healthcare professionals, make their diagnostic decisions more explainable.

AB  - As virtual reality (VR) sports training apps start to become more mainstream, it is important that human performance is measured from VR gameplay interaction data in a more meaningful way. <i>CleanSheet</i> is a VR training app that is played by over 100,000 users around the world. Many of those players are aspiring goalkeepers who want to use the app as a new way to train and improve their general goalkeeping performance. Whilst the leaderboards display how many shots players saved, these data do not take into account the difficulty of the shot faced. This study presents a regression model developed from a combination of existing expected goals (xG) models, goalkeeper performance metrics, and psychological research to produce a new shot difficulty metric called CSxG. Utilizing user save rate data as the target variable, a model was developed that incorporated three input variables relating to ball flight and in-goal positioning. Our analysis showed that the required rate of closure (RROC), adapted from Tau theory, was the most significant predictor of the proportion of goals conceded. A validation process evaluated the new xG model for <i>CleanSheet</i> by comparing its difficulty predictions against user performance data across players of varying skill levels. CSxG effectively predicted shot difficulty at the extremes but showed less accuracy for mid-range scores (0.4 to 0.8). Additional variables influencing shot difficulty, such as build-up play and goalpost size, were identified for future model enhancements. This research contributes to the advancement of predictive modeling in sports performance analysis, highlighting the potential for improved goalkeeper training and strategy development using VR technology.

AB  - This research investigates the compressive strength behavior of basalt fiber-reinforced concrete (BFRC) using machine learning models to optimize predictions and enhance its practical applications. The study incorporates various modeling techniques, including Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), Decision Trees, and Random Forest (RF), to evaluate their predictive capabilities. Basalt Fiber Reinforced Concrete (BFRC) is a composite material that incorporates basalt fibers into traditional concrete to enhance its mechanical and durability properties. The use of basalt fibers, derived from natural volcanic rocks, aligns with sustainability goals due to their eco-friendliness, cost-effectiveness, and high performance. BFRC combines structural excellence with sustainability, making it an ideal material for modern construction practices. Its ability to enhance performance, reduce environmental impact, and ensure long-term durability positions it as a pivotal solution for sustainable infrastructure development. The developed models were used to predict compressive strength of basalt fiber concrete (Cs_bf) using the concrete mixture contents, age, and fiber dimensions. All the developed models were created using "Orange Data Mining" software version 3.36. A total of three hundred and nine (309) records were collected from literature for compressive strength for different mixing ratios of basalt fiber concrete with concrete at different ages. Each record contains the following data: C-Cement content (Kg/m<sup>3</sup>), FA-Fly ash content (Kg/m<sup>3</sup>), W-Water content (Kg/m<sup>3</sup>), SP-Super-plasticizer content (Kg/m<sup>3</sup>), CAg-Coarse aggregates content (Kg/m<sup>3</sup>), FAg-Fine aggregates content (Kg/m<sup>3</sup>), Age-The concrete age at testing (days), L_b-length of basalt fibers (mm), d_bf-Diameter of basalt fibers (µm), V_bf-Volume content of basalt fibers (%) and Cs_bf-Compressive strength of basalt fibre concrete (MPa). The collected records were divided into training set (249 records≈80%) and validation set (60 records≈ 20%). At the end of the process, it can be shown that the present research work outclassed other ML techniques applied in the previous research paper, which reported the utilization of the same size of data entries and basalt reinforced concrete constituents. Taylor chart for measured compressive strength of basalt fiber reinforced concrete predicted with ANN, KNN, SVM, Tree and RF is presented for comparing the performance of predictive models by illustrating three key statistical measures simultaneously: the correlation coefficient (R), the normalized standard deviation (σ), and the root-mean-square error (RMSE). Finally, it can be deduced that after considering the performance indices of the selected ensemble and classification models utilized in this present research paper, all the developed modes have almost the same excellent level of accuracy 95%, but ANN, KNN, and SVR produced R2 of 0.98 each with KNN producing MAE of 1.4 MPa, and MSE of 2.5 MPa to outperform ANN and SVR which produced MAE of 1.55 MPa/MSE of 4.1 MPa and MAE of 1.6 MPa/MSE of 3.85 MPa, respectively. Three techniques were used to estimate the impact of each input on the compressive strength, namely correlation matrix, sensitivity analysis and relative importance chart.

          <jats:p>The General Movements Analysis (GMA) has demonstrated noteworthy promise in the early detection of infantile Cerebral Palsy (CP). However, it is subjective and requires highly trained clinicians, making it costly and time-consuming. Automation of GMA could potentially enhance accessibility and further our comprehension of infants’ full-body movements. This paper investigates the feasibility of using 2D and 3D pose estimation strategies to observe and scrutinize the infant’s comprehensive body movement attributes to improve our perspective to consider joint movement and positions over time as an alternative to GMA for early CP prediction. The study includes comprehensive movement analysis from video recordings for accurate and efficient analysis of infant movement by computing various metrics such as angle orientations at different predicted joint locations, postural information, postural variability, movement velocity, movement variability, and left–right movement coordination. Along with antigravity movements are assessed and tracked as indicators of CP. We employed a variety Machine Learning (ML) algorithms for CP classification based on a series of robust features that have been developed to enhance the interpretability of the model. The proposed approach is assessed through experimentation using the MINI-RGBD and RVI-38 datasets with a classification accuracy of 92% and 97.37% respectively. These results substantiate the efficacy of employing pose estimation techniques for the precocious prediction of infantile CP, highlighting the importance of monitoring changes in joint angles over time for accurate diagnosis and treatment planning.</jats:p>

AB  - Previous research emphasizes the significance of key performance metrics in determining match outcomes. The purpose of this study is to enhance the understanding of success in professional soccer by analyzing the relationship between match outcomes (win, lose, draw) and various Performance Indicators extracted from the Greek soccer league, as well as to develop a regression model of success in soccer. The sample consisted of all 91 matches from the first round of the 2020-2021 season of the Greek Football League. Utilizing Kruskal-Wallis tests, significant differences were found in goals scored, shots, and shots on target, ball possession, passing metrics, touches in the penalty area, and average shot distance (<i>p</i> < 0.05), with winning teams having demonstrated superior performance metrics. Moreover, winning teams engaged more in positional attacks and counterattacks with shots (<i>p</i> < 0.05). The binary logistic regression model applied to predict match outcomes identified shots on target, counterattacks, passes metrics, offensive duels and set pieces (penalties, free kicks) as key factors influencing the likelihood of winning (<i>p</i> < 0.05). These findings collectively highlight the importance of effective offensive play, including goal scoring, shooting accuracy, and ball possession, in determining the outcomes of soccer matches, with the regression model offering a nuanced understanding of these relationships.

AB  - Background: One of the common limitations in the treatment of cancer is in the early detection of this disease. The customary medical practice of cancer examination is a visual examination by the dermatologist followed by an invasive biopsy. Nonetheless, this symptomatic approach is time-consuming and prone to human errors. An automated machine learning model is essential to capacitate fast diagnoses and early treatment. Objective: The key objective of this study is to establish a fully automatic model that helps Dermatologists in skin cancer handling process in a way that could improve skin lesion classification accuracy. Method: The work is conducted following an implementation of a Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN) using the Python-based deep learning library Keras. We incorporated effective image filtering and enhancement algorithms such as bilateral filter to enhance feature detection and extraction during training. The Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN) needed slightly more fine-tuning to ripe a better return. Hyperparameter optimization was utilized for selecting the best-performed hyperparameter combinations and several network hyperparameters. In this work, we decreased the learning rate from the default 0.001 to 0.0002, and the momentum for Adam optimization algorithm from 0.9 to 0.5, in trying to reduce the instability issues related to GAN models and at each iteration the weights of the discriminative and generative network were updated to balance the loss between them. We endeavour to address a binary classification which predicts two classes present in our dataset, namely benign and malignant. More so, some well-known metrics such as the receiver operating characteristic -area under the curve and confusion matrix were incorporated for evaluating the results and classification accuracy. Results: The model generated very conceivable lesions during the early stages of the experiment and we could easily visualise a smooth transition in resolution along the way. Thus, we have achieved an overall test accuracy of 93.5% after fine-tuning most parameters of our network.  Conclusion: This classification model provides spatial intelligence that could be useful in the future for cancer risk prediction. Unfortunately, it is difficult to generate high quality images that are much like the synthetic real samples and to compare different classification methods given the fact that some methods use non-public datasets for training.

        <p>The cost of insurance is rising all over the world, with frequent proposed policies and fraud playing a role. In recent years, AI techniques have been increasingly used for numerous insurance tasks. However, AI researchers frequently struggle technically to understand the vast and sophisticated domain knowledge as well as rapidly changing literature. Although several studies have already been published on the use of artificial intelligence in the context of specific insurance tasks, our work provides a unified general survey of the existing literature, incorporating various AI techniques into all major insurance tasks by providing a systematic literature survey of the rapidly growing literature on artificial intelligence in the insurance industry. From 2017 to the present, we focus our research on machine learning, big data, blockchain, data mining, chatbot theory, and its application in fraud detection, insurance policy, claim prediction, rick prediction, and other areas to systematically introduce existing work in the insurance sector using AI techniques.</p>

AB  - <jats:p>This paper aims to introduce a robust framework for forecasting demand, including data preprocessing, data transformation and standardization, feature selection, cross‐validation, and regression ensemble framework. Bagging (random forest regression (RFR)), boosting (gradient boosting regression (GBR) and extreme gradient boosting regression (XGBR)), and stacking (STACK) are employed as ensemble models. Different machine learning (ML) approaches, including support vector regression (SVR), extreme learning machine (ELM), and multilayer perceptron neural network (MLP), are adopted as reference models. In order to maximize the determination coefficient (<jats:italic>R</jats:italic><jats:sup>2</jats:sup>) value and reduce the root mean square error (RMSE), hyperparameters are set using the grid search method. Using a steel industry dataset, all tests are carried out under identical experimental conditions. In this context, STACK<jats:sub>1</jats:sub> (ELM + GBR + XGBR‐SVR) and STACK<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> (ELM + GBR + XGBR‐LASSO) models provided better performance than other models. The highest accuracies of R<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> of 0.97 and 0.97 are obtained using STACK<jats:sub>1</jats:sub> and STACK<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>, respectively. Moreover, the rank according to performances is STACK<jats:sub>1</jats:sub>, STACK<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>, XGBR, GBR, RFR, MLP, ELM, and SVR. As it improves the performance of models and reduces the risk of decision‐making, the ensemble method can be used to forecast the demand in a steel industry one month ahead.</jats:p>

AB  - <jats:p>The container ship stowage planning problem (CSPP) is a very complex and challenging issue concerning the interests of shipping companies and ports. This article has developed a many-objective CSPP solution that optimizes ship stability and reduces the number of shifts over the whole route while at the same time considering realistic constraints such as the physical structure of the ship and the layout of the container yard. Use the initial metacentric height (GM) along with the ship’s heeling angle and trim to measure its stability. Meanwhile, use the total amount of relocation in the container terminal yard, the voluntary shift in the container ship’s bay, and the necessary shift of the future unloading port to measure the number of shifts on the whole route. This article proposes a variant of the nondominated sorting genetic algorithm III (NSGA-III) combined with local search components to solve this problem. The algorithm can produce a set of non-dominated solutions, then decision-makers can choose the best practical implementation based on their experience and preferences. After carrying out a large number of experiments on 48 examples, our calculation results show that the algorithm is effective compared with NSGA-II and random weighted genetic algorithms, especially when applied to solve many-objective CSPPs.</jats:p>

AB  - Abstract We propose a data-driven model to predict the short-term fatigue Damage Equivalent Loads (DEL) on a wake-affected wind turbine based on wind field inflow sensors and/or loads sensors deployed on an adjacent up-wind wind turbine. Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) with Bayesian hyperparameters calibration is proposed to obtain a surrogate from input random variables to output DELs in the blades and towers of the up-wind and wake-affected wind turbines. A sensitivity analysis based on the hyperparameters of the GPR and Kullback-Leibler divergence is conducted to assess the effect of different input on the obtained DELs. We provide qualitative recommendations for a minimal set of necessary and sufficient input random variables to minimize the error in the DEL predictions on the wake-affected wind turbine. Extensive simulations are performed comprising different random variables, including wind speed, turbulence intensity, shear exponent and inflow horizontal skewness. Furthermore, we include random variables related to the blades lift and drag coefficients with direct impact on the rotor aerodynamic induction, which governs the evolution and transport of the meandering wake. In addition, different spacing between the wind turbines and Wohler exponents for calculation of DELs are considered. The maximum prediction normalized mean squared error, obtained in the tower base DELs in the fore-aft direction of the wake affected wind turbine, is less than 4%. In the case of the blade root DELs, the overall prediction error is less than 1%. The proposed scheme promotes utilization of sparse structural monitoring (loads) measurements for improving diagnostics on wake-affected turbines.

AB  - Predictions for physical systems often rely upon knowledge acquired from ensembles of entities, e.g. ensembles of cells in biological sciences. For qualitative and quantitative analysis, these ensembles are simulated with parametric families of mechanistic models (MMs). Two classes of methodologies, based on Bayesian inference and population of models, currently prevail in parameter estimation for physical systems. However, in Bayesian analysis, uninformative priors for MM parameters introduce undesirable bias. Here, we propose how to infer parameters within the framework of stochastic inverse problems (SIPs), also termed data-consistent inversion, wherein the prior targets only uncertainties that arise due to MM non-invertibility. To demonstrate, we introduce new methods to solve SIPs based on rejection sampling, Markov chain Monte Carlo, and generative adversarial networks (GANs). In addition, to overcome limitations of SIPs, we reformulate SIPs based on constrained optimization and present a novel GAN to solve the constrained optimization problem.

AB  - In recent years, the field of construction engineering has experienced a significant paradigm shift, embracing the integration of machine learning (ML) methodologies, with a particular emphasis on forecasting the characteristics of steel-fiber-reinforced concrete (SFRC). Despite the theoretical sophistication of existing models, persistent challenges remain-their opacity, lack of transparency, and real-world relevance for practitioners. To address this gap and advance our current understanding, this study employs the extra gradient (XG) boosting algorithm, crafting a comprehensive approach. Grounded in a meticulously curated database drawn from 43 seminal publications, encompassing 420 distinct records, this research focuses predominantly on three primary fiber types: crimped, hooked, and mil-cut. Complemented by hands-on experimentation involving 20 diverse SFRC mixtures, this empirical campaign is further illuminated through the strategic use of partial dependence plots (PDPs), revealing intricate relationships between input parameters and consequent compressive strength. A pivotal revelation of this research lies in the identification of optimal SFRC formulations, offering tangible insights for real-world applications. The developed ML model stands out not only for its sophistication but also its tangible accuracy, evidenced by exemplary performance against independent datasets, boasting a commendable mean target-prediction ratio of 99%. To bridge the theory-practice gap, we introduce a user-friendly digital interface, thoroughly designed to guide professionals in optimizing and accurately predicting the compressive strength of SFRC. This research thus contributes to the construction and civil engineering sectors by enhancing predictive capabilities and refining mix designs, fostering innovation, and addressing the evolving needs of the industry.

AB  - Several studies employ multi-site rs-fMRI data for major depressive disorder (MDD) identification, with a specific site as the to-be-analyzed target domain and other site(s) as the source domain. But they usually suffer from significant inter-site heterogeneity caused by the use of different scanners and/or scanning protocols and fail to build generalizable models that can well adapt to multiple target domains. In this article, we propose a dual-expert fMRI harmonization (DFH) framework for automated MDD diagnosis. Our DFH is designed to simultaneously exploit data from a single labeled source domain/site and two unlabeled target domains for mitigating data distribution differences across domains. Specifically, the DFH consists of a domain-generic student model and two domain-specific teacher/expert models that are jointly trained to perform knowledge distillation through a deep collaborative learning module. A student model with strong generalizability is finally derived, which can be well adapted to unseen target domains and analysis of other brain diseases. To the best of our knowledge, this is among the first attempts to investigate multi-target fMRI harmonization for MDD diagnosis. Comprehensive experiments on 836 subjects with rs-fMRI data from 3 different sites show the superiority of our method. The discriminative brain functional connectivities identified by our method could be regarded as potential biomarkers for fMRI-related MDD diagnosis.

AB  - Background: The potential roles of affective responses to environmental stressors in individuals9 physical and mental health are complex and multi-faceted. This study, then, explores Chinese citizens9 emotional responses to COVID-19-related stressors and influence factors which may boost or buffer such effects. 
Methods: From late March to early June (2020), a cross-sectional study was conducted using an anonymous online questionnaire included demographic characteristics, COVID-19-related stressors related to individuals9 daily functioning, and the self-assessed impact of protective and adverse internal factors on emotions.
Results: 1,662 questionnaires were received from residents in 32 Chinese provinces classified by prevalence level according to COVID-19 infections. Among the 17 positive and negative emotional responses, agglomerative hierarchical clustering revealed four subclassifications: (1) stress relations; (2) missing someone relations; (3) individual relations; and (4) social relations. Additionally, heightened regional prevalence levels positively corresponded to intensity of stress relations. Lowest intensity of social relations was found in the areas surrounding Wuhan and coastal areas. Specially, economic- and work-related stressors as well as negative self-perceptions (e.g., suppression, emotionally unstable, self-denial) implicated in negative emotions. While positive emotions were tied to demographic characteristics (e.g., high education, young age and male) and protective traits (e.g., creativity, sympathy, social responsibility), and inversely linked to relationships- and pandemic-related stressors, etc.
Conclusion: Associations were clearly noted among Chinese residents9 emotions to specific stressors during pandemic. Providing appropriate psychological resources/supports during future or extended public health crises may help offset the cognitive burden of individuals striving to regain an adequate level of normalcy and emotional well-being.

AB  - Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a severe neurodegenerative disease with ill-defined pathogenesis, calling for urgent developments of new therapeutic regimens. Herein, we applied PandaOmics, an AI-driven target discovery platform, to analyze the expression profiles of central nervous system (CNS) samples (237 cases; 91 controls) from public datasets, and direct iPSC-derived motor neurons (diMNs) (135 cases; 31 controls) from Answer ALS. Seventeen high-confidence and eleven novel therapeutic targets were identified and will be released onto ALS.AI (http://als.ai/). Among the proposed targets screened in the c9ALS <i>Drosophila</i> model, we verified 8 unreported genes (<i>KCNB2</i>, <i>KCNS3</i>, <i>ADRA2B</i>, <i>NR3C1</i>, <i>P2RY14</i>, <i>PPP3CB</i>, <i>PTPRC</i>, and <i>RARA</i>) whose suppression strongly rescues eye neurodegeneration. Dysregulated pathways identified from CNS and diMN data characterize different stages of disease development. Altogether, our study provides new insights into ALS pathophysiology and demonstrates how AI speeds up the target discovery process, and opens up new opportunities for therapeutic interventions.

The set of quadratic constraints arising from this procedure has been solved by means of Evolution Strategies optimisation techniques, also adopted in Artificial Intelligence studies.

AB  - <jats:p>Disruptive behavior is a prevalent threat to constructive online engagement. Covert behaviors, such as trolling, are especially challenging to detect automatically, because they utilize deceptive strategies to manipulate conversation. We illustrate a novel approach to their detection: analyzing conversational structures instead of focusing only on messages in isolation. Building on conversation analysis, we demonstrate that (1) conversational actions and their norms provide concepts for a deeper understanding of covert disruption, and that (2) machine learning, natural language processing and structural analysis of conversation can complement message-level features to create models that surpass earlier approaches to trolling detection. Our models, developed for detecting overt (aggression) as well as covert (trolling) behaviors using prior studies’ message-level features and new conversational action features, achieved high accuracies (0.90 and 0.92, respectively). The findings offer a theoretically grounded approach to computationally analyzing social media interaction and novel methods for effectively detecting covert disruptive conversations online.</jats:p>

AB  - <jats:p>Cardiovascular illnesses have surpassed disease as the leading cause of death in industrialized, emerging, and underprivileged countries in recent decades. The mortality rate can be lowered through early detection and effective care of cardiac diseases. However, reliable detection of heart disorders in all conditions and serving doctors with 24-hour medical consultations are not possible since they require more intelligence, time, and talent to train the computer for a specific duty. Artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms may have a substantial impact on the lives of those who are afflicted with chronic diseases. In this work, we used artificial intelligence to create a hybrid model for the prediction of cardiac disease and flags for prevention. The goal of this research was to develop a prediction model that can identify and characterize a patient's illness. We used data of 68975 patients from the University of California, Irvine's repository and trained several algorithms for CVD illness prediction. In our simulation maximum classifiers have achieved the greatest accuracy, which is a huge accomplishment for our research team. Our proposed hybrid ML algorithm framework improved CVD prediction performance when compared to previously offered prediction models. The proposed methods are decision tree and random forest models, which have a 99.98% accuracy for training, followed by support vector machine, which has a 99.30% accuracy followed by other classifiers which yield higher results in comparison. Pre-existing CVD history was considered the most important factor determining the prediction model's accuracy. Our findings reveal that our CVD prediction model based on machine learning techniques developed for health screening datasets is simple to apply and more accurate. Our proposed classifiers have the best accuracy rate.</jats:p>

AB  - The convolutional neural network methodologies have been a fundamental deep learning solution to smart grid applications. It is essential to investigate and evaluate the progress of this method in the smart grid. Consequently, a comprehensive investigation with the aid of PRISMA had been conducted. The PRISMA standard queries including the convolutional neural networks and its abbreviation forms of ConvNet or CNN reveal a significant increase in the popularity of this deep learning method in smart grid applications. This research identifies 2200 pieces of literature in the field. After considering the PRISMA guideline the most relevant and fundamental application had been reduced to 46 documents where the single and hybrid methods had been identified. The investigation showed that hybrid methods delivered a better performance with higher accuracy. It is expected that more hybrid methods will have emerged in the smart grid application.

AB  - Methods in protein design have made it possible to create large and complex, self-assembling protein cages with diverse applications. These have largely been based on highly symmetric forms exemplified by the Platonic solids. Prospective applications of protein cages would be expanded by strategies for breaking the designed symmetry, <i>e.g.</i>, so that only one or a few (instead of many) copies of an exterior domain or motif might be displayed on their surfaces. Here we demonstrate a straightforward design approach for creating symmetry-broken protein cages able to display singular copies of outward-facing domains. We modify the subunit of an otherwise symmetric protein cage through fusion to a small inward-facing domain, only one copy of which can be accommodated in the cage interior. Using biochemical methods and native mass spectrometry, we show that co-expression of the original subunit and the modified subunit, which is further fused to an outward-facing anti-GFP DARPin domain, leads to self-assembly of a protein cage presenting just one copy of the DARPin protein on its exterior. This strategy of designed occlusion provides a facile route for creating new types of protein cages with unique properties.

AB  - In association football, predicting the likelihood and outcome of a shot at a goal is useful but challenging. Expected goal (xG) models can be used in a variety of ways including evaluating performance and designing offensive strategies. This study proposed a novel framework that uses the events preceding a shot, to improve the accuracy of the expected goals (xG) metric. A combination of previously explored and unexplored temporal features is utilized in the proposed framework. The new features include; "advancement factor", and "player position column". A random forest model was used, which performed better than published single-event-based models in the literature. Results further demonstrated a significant improvement in model performance with the inclusion of preceding event information. The proposed framework and model enable the discovery of event sequences that improve xG, which include; opportunities built up from the sides of the 18-yard box, shots attempted from in front of the goal within the opposition's 18-yard box, and shots from successful passes to the far post.

This could be attributed to various factors such as response to stimuli, physical factors, psychological factors etc. The present study incorporated the prediction of the most suited playing position of elite male football players using machine learning approaches based on their Anthropometric Parameters (AP–11 parameters) and Motor Fitness Parameters (MFP–7 parameters). Of the features analysed, results identified the position indicative nature of some parameters among6 AP (Height, Body Mass Index, Basal Metabolic Rate, Fat %, Thigh Circumference, Calf circumference) and 4 MFP (120 m, 80 m, 40 m dash and T-Test) by Spearman’s Rank Correlation Test. Further, the prediction of ideal playing position was achieved using various classifiers such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), SVM with over sampled data, SVM with hyperparameter tuning, SVM with variable scaling and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XG Boost). Among these, the highest classification accuracy and f1-score at 92% and 0.92 respectively were obtained for XG Boost Classifier which portrayed a faster performance as compared to the other approaches. The present study could be useful in professional sports training and rehabilitation so as to help the players perform better in the football game.</jats:p>

AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Quantum Chromodynamics, the theory of quarks and gluons, whose interactions can be described by a local SU(3) gauge symmetry with charges called “color quantum numbers”, is reviewed; the goal of this review is to provide advanced Ph.D. students a comprehensive handbook, helpful for their research. When QCD was “discovered” 50 years ago, the idea that quarks could exist, but not be observed, left most physicists unconvinced. Then, with the discovery of charmonium in 1974 and the explanation of its excited states using the Cornell potential, consisting of the sum of a Coulomb-like attraction and a long range linear confining potential, the theory was suddenly widely accepted. This paradigm shift is now referred to as the<jats:italic>November revolution</jats:italic>. It had been anticipated by the observation of scaling in deep inelastic scattering, and was followed by the discovery of gluons in three-jet events.

Lattice QCD (LQCD), numerical calculations on a discretized space-time lattice, is discussed in detail, the dynamics of the QCD vacuum is visualized, and the expected spectra of mesons and baryons are displayed. Progress in lattice calculations of the structure of nucleons and of quantities related to the phase diagram of dense and hot (or cold) hadronic matter are reviewed. Methods and examples of how to calculate hadronic corrections to weak matrix elements on a lattice are outlined. The wide variety of analytical approximations currently in use, and the accuracy of these approximations, are reviewed. These methods range from the Bethe–Salpeter, Dyson–Schwinger coupled relativistic equations, which are formulated in both Minkowski or Euclidean spaces, to expansions of multi-quark states in a set of basis functions using light-front coordinates, to the AdS/QCD method that imbeds 4-dimensional QCD in a 5-dimensional deSitter space, allowing confinement and spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking to be described in a novel way. Models that assume the number of colors is very large, i.e. make use of the large<jats:inline-formula><jats:alternatives><jats:tex-math>$$N_c$$</jats:tex-math><mml:math xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mml:msub><mml:mi>N</mml:mi><mml:mi>c</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:math></jats:alternatives></jats:inline-formula>-limit, give unique insights. Many other techniques that are tailored to specific problems, such as perturbative expansions for high energy scattering or approximate calculations using the operator product expansion are discussed. The very powerful effective field theory techniques that are successful for low energy nuclear systems (chiral effective theory), or for non-relativistic systems involving heavy quarks, or the treatment of gluon exchanges between energetic, collinear partons encountered in jets, are discussed. The spectroscopy of mesons and baryons has played an important historical role in the development of QCD. The famous X,Y,Z states – and the discovery of pentaquarks – have revolutionized hadron spectroscopy; their status and interpretation are reviewed as well as recent progress in the identification of glueballs and hybrids in light-meson spectroscopy. These exotic states add to the spectrum of expected<jats:inline-formula><jats:alternatives><jats:tex-math>$$q{{\bar{q}}}$$</jats:tex-math><mml:math xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>q</mml:mi><mml:mover><mml:mrow><mml:mi>q</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>¯</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mover></mml:mrow></mml:math></jats:alternatives></jats:inline-formula>mesons and<jats:italic>qqq</jats:italic>baryons. The progress in understanding excitations of light and heavy baryons is discussed. The nucleon as the lightest baryon is discussed extensively, its form factors, its partonic structure and the status of the attempt to determine a three-dimensional picture of the parton distribution. An experimental program to study the phase diagram of QCD at high temperature and density started with fixed target experiments in various laboratories in the second half of the 1980s, and then, in this century, with colliders. QCD thermodynamics at high temperature became accessible to LQCD, and numerical results on chiral and deconfinement transitions and properties of the deconfined and chirally restored form of strongly interacting matter, called the Quark–Gluon Plasma (QGP), have become very precise by now. These results can now be confronted with experimental data that are sensitive to the nature of the phase transition. There is clear evidence that the QGP phase is created. This phase of QCD matter can already be characterized by some properties that indicate, within a temperature range of a few times the pseudocritical temperature, the medium behaves like a near ideal liquid. Experimental observables are presented that demonstrate deconfinement. High and ultrahigh density QCD matter at moderate and low temperatures shows interesting features and new phases that are of astrophysical relevance. They are reviewed here and some of the astrophysical implications are discussed. Perturbative QCD and methods to describe the different aspects of scattering processes are discussed. The primary parton–parton scattering in a collision is calculated in perturbative QCD with increasing complexity. The radiation of soft gluons can spoil the perturbative convergence, this can be cured by resummation techniques, which are also described here. Realistic descriptions of QCD scattering events need to model the cascade of quark and gluon splittings until hadron formation sets in, which is done by parton showers. The full event simulation can be performed with Monte Carlo event generators, which simulate the full chain from the hard interaction to the hadronic final states, including the modelling of non-perturbative components. The contribution of the LEP experiments (and of earlier collider experiments) to the study of jets is reviewed. Correlations between jets and the shape of jets had allowed the collaborations to determine the “color factors” – invariants of the SU(3) color group governing the strength of quark–gluon and gluon–gluon interactions. The calculated jet production rates (using perturbative QCD) are shown to agree precisely with data, for jet energies spanning more than five orders of magnitude. The production of jets recoiling against a vector boson,<jats:inline-formula><jats:alternatives><jats:tex-math>$$W^\pm $$</jats:tex-math><mml:math xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mml:msup><mml:mi>W</mml:mi><mml:mo>±</mml:mo></mml:msup></mml:math></jats:alternatives></jats:inline-formula>or<jats:italic>Z</jats:italic>, is shown to be well understood. The discovery of the Higgs boson was certainly an important milestone in the development of high-energy physics. The couplings of the Higgs boson to massive vector bosons and fermions that have been measured so far support its interpretation as mass-generating boson as predicted by the Standard Model. The study of the Higgs boson recoiling against hadronic jets (without or with heavy flavors) or against vector bosons is also highlighted. Apart from the description of hard interactions taking place at high energies, the understanding of “soft QCD” is also very important. In this respect, Pomeron – and Odderon – exchange, soft and hard diffraction are discussed. Weak decays of quarks and leptons, the quark mixing matrix and the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon are processes which are governed by weak interactions. However, corrections by strong interactions are important, and these are reviewed. As the measured values are incompatible with (most of) the predictions, the question arises: are these discrepancies first hints for New Physics beyond the Standard Model? This volume concludes with a description of future facilities or important upgrades of existing facilities which improve their luminosity by orders of magnitude. The best is yet to come!</jats:p>

AB  - <AbstractText Label="INTRODUCTION" NlmCategory="BACKGROUND">Risk prediction models are increasingly used in healthcare to aid in clinical decision-making. In most clinical contexts, model calibration (i.e., assessing the reliability of risk estimates) is critical. Data available for model development are often not perfectly balanced with the modeled outcome (i.e., individuals with vs. without the event of interest are not equally prevalent in the data). It is common for researchers to correct for class imbalance, yet, the effect of such imbalance corrections on the calibration of machine learning models is largely unknown.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="METHODS" NlmCategory="METHODS">We studied the effect of imbalance corrections on model calibration for a variety of machine learning algorithms. Using extensive Monte Carlo simulations we compared the out-of-sample predictive performance of models developed with an imbalance correction to those developed without a correction for class imbalance across different data-generating scenarios (varying sample size, the number of predictors, and event fraction). Our findings were illustrated in a case study using MIMIC-III data.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="RESULTS">In all simulation scenarios, prediction models developed without a correction for class imbalance consistently had equal or better calibration performance than prediction models developed with a correction for class imbalance. The miscalibration introduced by correcting for class imbalance was characterized by an over-estimation of risk and was not always able to be corrected with re-calibration.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="CONCLUSION" NlmCategory="CONCLUSIONS">Correcting for class imbalance is not always necessary and may even be harmful to clinical prediction models which aim to produce reliable risk estimates on an individual basis.</AbstractText>

AB  - Reconstruction algorithms are at the forefront of accessible and compact data collection. In this paper, we present a novel reconstruction algorithm, SpecRA, that adapts based on the relative rarity of a signal compared to previous observations. We leverage a data-driven approach to learn optimal encoder-array sensitivities for a novel filter-array spectrometer. By taking advantage of the regularities mined from diverse online repositories, we are able to exploit low-dimensional patterns for improved spectral reconstruction from as few as p=2 channels. Furthermore, the performance of SpecRA is largely independent of signal complexity. Our results illustrate the superiority of our method over conventional approaches and provide a framework towards "fourth paradigm" spectral sensing. We hope that this work can help reduce the size, weight and cost constraints of future spectrometers for specific spectral monitoring tasks in applied contexts such as in remote sensing, healthcare, and quality control.

AB  - <b>Background:</b> Postoperative ileus (POI) is a common complication after colorectal surgery, leading to increased hospital stay and costs. This study aimed to explore patient comorbidities that contribute to the development of POI in the colorectal surgical population and compare machine learning (ML) model accuracy to existing risk instruments. <b>Study Design:</b> In a retrospective study, data were collected on 316 adult patients who underwent colorectal surgery from January 2020 to December 2021. The study excluded patients undergoing multi-visceral resections, re-operations, or combined primary and metastatic resections. Patients lacking follow-up within 90 days after surgery were also excluded. Eight different ML models were trained and cross-validated using 29 patient comorbidities and four comorbidity risk indices (ASA Status, NSQIP, CCI, and ECI). <b>Results:</b> The study found that 6.33% of patients experienced POI. Age, BMI, gender, kidney disease, anemia, arrhythmia, rheumatoid arthritis, and NSQIP score were identified as significant predictors of POI. The ML models with the greatest accuracy were AdaBoost tuned with grid search (94.2%) and XG Boost tuned with grid search (85.2%). <b>Conclusions:</b> This study suggests that ML models can predict the risk of POI with high accuracy and may offer a new frontier in early detection and intervention for postoperative outcome optimization. ML models can greatly improve the prediction and prevention of POI in colorectal surgery patients, which can lead to improved patient outcomes and reduced healthcare costs. Further research is required to validate and assess the replicability of these results.

AB  - Antigen-specific T cell receptor (TCR) sequences can have prognostic, predictive, and therapeutic value, but decoding the specificity of TCR recognition remains challenging. Unlike DNA strands that base pair, TCRs bind to their targets with different orientations and different lengths, which complicates comparisons. We present scanning parametrized by normalized TCR length (SPAN-TCR) to analyze antigen-specific TCR CDR3 sequences and identify patterns driving TCR-pMHC specificity. Using entropic analysis, SPAN-TCR identifies 2-mer motifs that decrease the diversity (entropy) of CDR3s. These motifs are the most common patterns that can predict CDR3 composition, and we identify "essential" motifs that decrease entropy in the same CDR3 α or β chain containing the 2-mer, and "super-essential" motifs that decrease entropy in both chains. Molecular dynamics analysis further suggests that these motifs may play important roles in binding. We then employ SPAN-TCR to resolve similarities in TCR repertoires against different antigens using public databases of TCR sequences.

AB  - <jats:p>This study aims to develop a multi-functional robotic arm with a multi-degree of freedom using a pneumatic artificial muscle cylinder as the main actuator, with a wearable function. While wearing the robotic arm, it has four degrees of freedom and can be used as an upper limb rehabilitation aid to perform rehabilitation exercise tasks. The rotating axes are driven by pneumatic artificial muscle cylinders to ensure the safety and flexibility of the robot interaction. By integrating multiple pneumatic control valves and sensors with embedded interface cards, the control of pneumatic artificial muscle cylinders is performed, and the rehabilitation trajectory commands are planned through the kinematics of the robotic arm, and a closed-loop control system is established to enable the robotic arm to achieve the task of rehabilitation trajectory tracking. In the single-axis robotic arm controller experiment, it was found that the LMS-PID is superior to the conventional PID control method. In the control experiment of the robotic arm under the multi-axis recovery trajectory, the result showed that the training of drawing a circle on the wall could be successfully planned. In the multi-axis robotic tracking experiment under the rehabilitation trajectory, the result showed that the RMSE of the tracking trajectory decreased to 0.2444 and 0.2853. In the robotic arm joining/loading experiment, it was shown that the method of this study can withstand some loading effects. Moreover, this study introduces iterative learning control to improve the non-linear compensation and phase lag problems of the PID controller so that the robot arm can have a certain tracking accuracy under the round-trip robust trajectory.</jats:p>

AB  - Nuclear resonant vibrational spectroscopy (NRVS) is a synchrotron radiation (SR)-based nuclear inelastic scattering spectroscopy that measures the phonons (i.e., vibrational modes) associated with the nuclear transition. It has distinct advantages over traditional vibration spectroscopy and has wide applications in physics, chemistry, bioinorganic chemistry, materials sciences, and geology, as well as many other research areas. In this article, we present a scientific and figurative description of this yet modern tool for the potential users in various research fields in the future. In addition to short discussions on its development history, principles, and other theoretical issues, the focus of this article is on the experimental aspects, such as the instruments, the practical measurement issues, the data process, and a few examples of its applications. The article concludes with introduction to non-57Fe NRVS and an outlook on the impact from the future upgrade of SR rings.

Numerous studies have identified families with children as the primary contributors to food waste. The aims of this paper is to enhance the comprehension of food waste behaviors in households with children by characterizing it and studying how socioeconomic characteristics and food-related behaviors can predict it.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="Methods" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">A survey was conducted among 806 families with children, categorized by the child's age and family structure. The study utilized descriptive statistics to summarize the food waste behaviors and binary regression to evaluate the predictive abilities of 12 variable related to the socio-economic characteristic, purchase, and preparation behaviors and diet quality factors.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="Results" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">Perishable food items, such as fruits, vegetables, cereal-based product, and dairy products, were the primary items wasted in households with children. Two patterns of food waste were identified: inadequate food management leading to small amounts of waste in families with young and middle-aged children, and over-purchasing perishable items leading to waste in other households with children. Household type and purchasing habits were significant predictors, while the purchaser's age and buying channel showed lower predictive capacity.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="Discussion" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">Policies to reduce food waste should prioritize raising awareness among children, promoting good practices at the household level, and creating favorable conditions during purchases. Strategies include enlisting children's participation in meal planning and food preparation as well as limiting the promotion of ultra-processed products and incentivizing the sale of bulk products at supermarket.</AbstractText>

AB  - <jats:p>Abstract: Alzheimer's disease is a progressive neurological brain disorder that gradually destroys memory cells and causes the brain to shrink. It is the most common cause of Dementia, which results in a steady decline in cognitive skills such as thinking, social, and behavioral skills, affecting the person's ability to work independently. This disease is usually found in theage group of 65 years and above. Alzheimer's disease must be detected early in order to prevent the disease from progressing irreversibly. In this work, an approach for detecting Alzheimer's disease in its early stages is proposed. The proposed method employs a Machine Learning algorithm to diagnose Alzheimer's disease from an MRI scan of the Hippocampus. The Hippocampus region's area, shape, and texture features are retrieved, and the percentage and stages of Alzheimer's Disease are detected using these features. For feature extraction and feature classification, Machine Learning algorithms such as Convolutional Neural Network and K-Nearest Neighbor are utilised. In comparison to other conventional methodologies, the proposed approach is predicted to provide improved accuracy</jats:p>

AB  - As AI models continue to advance into many real-life applications, their ability to maintain reliable quality over time becomes increasingly important. The principal challenge in this task stems from the very nature of current machine learning models, dependent on the data as it was at the time of training. In this study, we present the first analysis of AI "aging": the complex, multifaceted phenomenon of AI model quality degradation as more time passes since the last model training cycle. Using datasets from four different industries (healthcare operations, transportation, finance, and weather) and four standard machine learning models, we identify and describe the main temporal degradation patterns. We also demonstrate the principal differences between temporal model degradation and related concepts that have been explored previously, such as data concept drift and continuous learning. Finally, we indicate potential causes of temporal degradation, and suggest approaches to detecting aging and reducing its impact.

AB  - Glucocorticoids are potent immunosuppressive drugs, but long-term treatment leads to severe side-effects. While there is a commonly accepted model for GR-mediated gene activation, the mechanism behind repression remains elusive. Understanding the molecular action of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) mediated gene repression is the first step towards developing novel therapies. We devised an approach that combines multiple epigenetic assays with 3D chromatin data to find sequence patterns predicting gene expression change. We systematically tested> 100 models to evaluate the best way to integrate the data types and found that GR-bound regions hold most of the information needed to predict the polarity of Dex-induced transcriptional changes. We confirmed NF-κB motif family members as predictors for gene repression and identified STAT motifs as additional negative predictors.

AB  - Triple‑negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a highly heterogeneous and aggressive malignancy. Due to the absence of estrogen receptors and progesterone receptors and the lack of overexpression of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2, TNBC responds poorly to endocrine and targeted therapies. As a neoadjuvant therapy, chemotherapy is usually the only option for TNBC; however, chemotherapy may induce tumor resistance. The emergence of immunotherapy as an adjuvant therapy is expected to make up for the deficiency of chemotherapy. Most of the research on immunotherapies has been performed on advanced metastatic TNBC, which has provided significant clinical benefits. In the present review, possible immunotherapy targets and ongoing immunotherapy strategies were discussed. In addition, progress in research on immune checkpoint inhibitors in early TNBC was outlined.

        <p>Reducing defects and creating new industrial products are issues addressed in literature, though often separately. This work presents a unique approach combining machine learning and optimization techniques, which could 1) predict and explain ongoing production defects, 2) prescribe solutions to prevent predicted defects, and 3) produce defect predictors for novel products without historical data. By applying it into a melamine-surfaced boards process, task 1) explored SVM, XGBoost and Random Forest algorithms, coupled with an explainable model-agnostic approach. A Powell’s method-based meta-heuristic algorithm handled task 2), while the Hyper-Process Model (HPM) technique was selected in task 3). Defect prediction presented strong results, with a fine-tuned XGBoost with oversampling achieving over 0.8 recall value, and prescriptions significantly reduced prediction scores across most defect scenarios. Although the HPM implementation introduced challenges producing predictors, most generated synthetic data-trained models achieved encouraging performances on recall metrics. Results could serve as baseline for future developments.</p>

AB  - Recently, the combination of video services and 5G networks have been gaining attention in the wireless communication realm. With the brisk advancement in 5G network usage and the massive popularity of three-dimensional video streaming, the quality of experience (QoE) of video in 5G systems has been receiving overwhelming significance from both customers and service provider ends. Therefore, effectively categorizing QoE-aware video streaming is imperative for achieving greater client satisfaction. This work makes the following contribution: First, a simulation platform based on NS-3 is introduced to analyze and improve the performance of video services. The simulation is formulated to offer real-time measurements, saving the expensive expenses associated with real-world equipment. Second, A valuable framework for QoE-aware video streaming categorization is introduced in 5G networks based on machine learning (ML) by incorporating the hyperparameter tuning (HPT) principle. It implements an enhanced hyperparameter tuning (EHPT) ensemble and decision tree (DT) classifier for video streaming categorization. The performance of the ML approach is assessed by considering precision, accuracy, recall, and computation time metrics for manifesting the superiority of these classifiers regarding video streaming categorization. This paper demonstrates that our ML classifiers achieve QoE prediction accuracy of 92.59% for (EHPT) ensemble and 87.037% for decision tree (DT) classifiers.

AB  - Quantitatively and predictively linking the composition and function of microbial communities is a major aspiration of microbial ecology. It is also a critical step in the path toward engineering synthetic consortia and manipulating natural microbiomes. The functions of microbial communities are collective properties that emerge from a complex web of molecular interactions between individual cells, which in turn lead to population-level interactions among strains and species. Incorporating this complexity into predictive models has been highly challenging. A similar problem of predicting phenotype from genotype has been addressed for decades in the field of quantitative genetics, leading to advances in the fields of protein and molecular engineering. By analogy to the genotype-phenotype landscape, an ecological community-function (or structure-function) landscape could be defined that maps community composition and function. In this piece, we present an overview of our current understanding of these community landscapes, their uses, limitations, and open questions. We argue that exploiting the parallels between both landscapes could bring powerful predictive methodologies from evolution and genetics into ecology, providing a boost to our ability to engineer and optimize microbial consortia.

AB  - Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) have gained immense popularity as a power source in various applications. Accurately predicting the health status of these batteries is crucial for optimizing their performance, minimizing operating expenses, and preventing failures. In this paper, we present a comprehensive review of the latest developments in predicting the state of charge (SOC), state of health (SOH), and remaining useful life (RUL) of LIBs, and particularly focus on machine learning techniques. This paper delves into the degradation mechanisms of LIBs and their underlying theories, providing an in-depth analysis of the strengths and limitations of various machine learning techniques used to predict SOC, SOH and RUL. Furthermore, this review sheds light on the challenges encountered in the practical application of electric vehicles, especially concerning battery degradation. It also offers valuable insights into the future research directions for LIBs. While machine learning methods hold great promise in enhancing the accuracy of predicting SOC, SOH, and RUL, there remain numerous technical and practical obstacles that must be overcome to make them more applicable in real-world scenarios.

AB  - The prosperity of mobile and financial technologies has bred and expanded various kinds of financial products to a broader scope of people, which contributes to advocating financial inclusion. It has non-trivial social benefits of diminishing financial inequality. However, the technical challenges in individual financial risk evaluation caused by the distinct characteristic distribution and limited credit history of new users, as well as the inexperience of newly-entered companies in handling complex data and obtaining accurate labels, impede further promoting financial inclusion. To tackle these challenges, this paper develops a novel transfer learning algorithm (i.e., TransBoost) that combines the merits of tree-based models and kernel methods. The TransBoost is designed with a parallel tree structure and efficient weights updating mechanism with theoretical guarantee, which enables it to excel in tackling real-world data with high dimensional features and sparsity in $O(n)$ time complexity. We conduct extensive experiments on two public datasets and a unique large-scale dataset from Tencent Mobile Payment. The results show that the TransBoost outperforms other state-of-the-art benchmark transfer learning algorithms in terms of prediction accuracy with superior efficiency, shows stronger robustness to data sparsity, and provides meaningful model interpretation. Besides, given a financial risk level, the TransBoost enables financial service providers to serve the largest number of users including those who would otherwise be excluded by other algorithms. That is, the TransBoost improves financial inclusion.

AB  - The Healthy China Strategy puts realistic demands for residents' health levels, but the reality is that various factors can affect health. In order to clarify which factors have a great impact on residents' health, based on China's provincial panel data from 2011 to 2018, this paper selects 17 characteristic variables from the three levels of economy, environment, and society and uses the XG boost algorithm and Random forest algorithm based on recursive feature elimination to determine the influencing variables. The results show that at the economic level, the number of industrial enterprises above designated size, industrial added value, population density, and per capita GDP have a greater impact on the health of residents. At the environmental level, coal consumption, energy consumption, total wastewater discharge, and solid waste discharge have a greater impact on the health level of residents. Therefore, the Chinese government should formulate targeted measures at both economic and environmental levels, which is of great significance to realizing the Healthy China strategy.

AB  - <jats:p>Abstract: Effective bankruptcy forecasting is essential for financial firms to make sound loan decisions. In general, the two most essential aspects influencing prediction performance are input variables (or features) such as financial ratios and prediction approaches such as statistical and machine learning techniques. While numerous relevant publications have presented innovative prediction algorithms, relatively few have examined the discriminating potential of bankruptcy prediction variables. In addition to financial ratios (FRs), corporate governance indicators (CGIs) have been identified as an important form of input variable in the literature. The prediction performance produced by merging CGIs with FRs, however, has not been thoroughly investigated. Only a subset of CGIs and FRs were employed in related investigations, and the characteristics used may vary from study to study. As a result, the goal of this work is to evaluate the prediction performance obtained by combining seven distinct FR categories and five different CGI categories. Based on a real-world dataset from Taiwan, the experimental results reveal that the FR categories of solvency and profitability, as well as the CGI categories of board structure and ownership structure, are the most critical variables in bankruptcy prediction. The best prediction model performance is determined by combining prediction accuracy, Type I/II errors, ROC curve, and misclassification cost. However, these findings may not be applicable in certain countries, such as China, where the definition of distressed enterprises is vague and the features of corporate governance measures are not explicit.</jats:p>

AB  - Determination and prediction of atomic cluster structures is an important endeavor in the field of nanoclusters and thereby in materials research. To a large extent the fundamental properties of a nanocluster are mainly governed by its molecular structure. Traditionally, structure elucidation is achieved using quantum mechanics (QM) based calculations that are usually tedious and time consuming for large nanoclusters. Various structural prediction algorithms have been reported in the literature (CALYPSO, USPEX). Although they tend to accelerate the structure exploration, they still require the aid of QM based calculations for structure evaluation. This makes the structure prediction process quite a computationally expensive affair. In this paper, we report on the creation of a convolutional neural network model, which can give relatively accurate energies for the ground state of nanoclusters from the promolecule density on the fly and could thereby be utilized for aiding structure prediction algorithms. We tested our model on dataset consisting of pure boron nanoclusters of varying sizes.

AB  - <jats:p>Recently, the analysis of communication has gained attention in experimental research. One important question is whether certain types of communication affect decisions differently than others. In this regard, Houser &amp; Xiao (2011) present an approach for the classification of natural language messages. The primary limitation of their approach is its limited applicability to large message datasets. Therefore, Penczynski (2019) extends the methodological instruments by applying a machine learning classifier to experimental communication data. This is accompanied by the problem of a dearth of machine learning knowledge among experimenters. Hence, this paper presents an approach that employs a publicly available machine learning text analysis application. This makes it possible to analyze larger datasets based on small training datasets classified beforehand by human evaluators. As a first step, I use primary communication data reported by Charness and Dufwenberg (2006) to generate both training and test datasets. Following this approach, I am able to substantially replicate the original classification results obtained by Charness and Dufwenberg. The second step again involves messages from Charness and Dufwenberg as training data, while I take messages from a related trust game published by Deck et al. (2013) as a test, dataset. Promisingly, I am also able to replicate the classification results obtained by the external evaluators, as reported by Deck et al. The findings suggest that machine learning can be used to analyze large message datasets, both if the artificial intelligence is trained with data from the very same experiment and if it is trained with message data from a comparable experiment.</jats:p>

AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>The application of computer vision continues to widen with advancement in technology. Imaging systems which provide necessary inputs to the computer-vision-based models can come in various ways. Such as X-ray images, Computed Tomography (CT) scan images, and Infrared (IR) images. This paper is a review of different application areas of infrared thermography (IRT) for monitoring the status of electrical power equipment. It summarizes in tabular form recent research and relevant works within the field of condition monitoring of power assets. A general review of the application of IRT in power devices was undertaken before a specific review of selected works based on IRT for important electrical power equipment with a tabular review of possible causes of hotspots using photovoltaic installation as a reference. Results of previous works were presented with highlights on performance metrics used and accuracies achieved. Emphasis where made on the future potential of IRT and some associated techniques. The work saw that heat production within systems during operation is an important characteristic that enables IRT to become applicable for monitoring diverse physical systems, most importantly power systems. The high cost of high-definition, and long-range IR cameras limits the wide adoption of the technology for its potential applications for monitoring power installations. The work recommends future research in the development of affordable IR imaging systems with advanced features for condition monitoring of physical systems such as power installations.</jats:p>

AB  - With advanced science and digital technology, digital transformation has become an important way to promote the sustainable development of enterprises. However, the existing research only focuses on the linear relationship between a single characteristic and digital transformation. In this study, we select the data of Chinese A-share listed companies from 2010 to 2020, innovatively use the machine learning method and explore the differences in the predictive effects of multi-dimensional features on the digital transformation of enterprises based on the Technology-Organization-Environment (TOE) theory, thus identifying the main drivers affecting digital transformation and the fitting models with stronger predictive effect. The study found that: first, by comparing machine learning and traditional linear regression models, it is found that the prediction ability of ensemble earning method is generally higher than that of tradition measurement method. For the sample data selected in this research, XGBoost and LightGBM have strong explanatory ability and high prediction accuracy. Second, compared with the technical driving force and environmental driving force, the organizational driving force has a greater impact. Third, among these characteristics, equity concentration and executives' knowledge level in organizational dimension have the greatest impact on digital transformation. Therefore, enterprise managers should always pay attention to the decision-making role of equity concentration and executives' knowledge level. This study further enriches the literature on digital transformation in enterprises, expands the application of machine learning in economics, and provides a theoretical basis for enterprises to enhance digital transformation.

AB  - This study examines school-based and land-based language materials for Kwakwala (ISO, kwk) developed during a three-year investigation (2016-2019). The materials focussed on three requirements: first, supporting teachers and researchers who are learning the language, second, ensuring that documentation is accurate and conforms to curriculum and guidelines from Elders, and third, integrating Indigenous language and knowledge throughout school activities and revitalization of traditional homelands. I address the above requirements using a Transdisciplinary model to approach the complex multi-disciplinary needs of the school and land-based activities. These require Indigenous knowledge and expertise from numerous disciplines. In this study, similar to Mark and Turk (2021), various disciplines (Indigenous and Western-based) are unified through an overarching theory. Situated Learning is the unifying theory to ensure language, social, cultural, and locational contexts are authentic and situated in Indigenous settings. Evidence-based analysis is the over-arching method used to examine the materials. Together, these frame Situated Documentation, a method used in this study to situate community-based documentation in authentic locations. Participatory Action Research integrates the expertise of school staff, researchers, experts, Chiefs and Elders with the researcher. Transdisciplinary highlights include Word Paradigm corpus-based concordance analysis to compare Kwakwala inflections in materials with curriculum expectations, multimodal ethnographic coding of print and multimedia materials to examine the situational accuracy and consistency of language and social conventions, and comparative analysis to determine the communicative competence in narratives. In addition, analyses include comparison with earlier materials, attention to ethnophysiography, and examination of the study developed computer based parser to correct difficulties with written documentation. In conclusion, the materials developed during the study assist the community and the school to achieve their goals to revitalize their homelands and language. The materials meet curriculum expectations, represent language and Indigenous themes, conform to Indigenous social values and dialect variation, and demonstrate authentic and accurate land-based documentation. Results from computer-based parsing demonstrate improved documentation of written language. Recommendations indicate that non fluent teachers benefit from grammatical-functional materials and links between curriculum expectations and language structures, while both teachers and land-based researchers benefit from situating documentation activities in authentic locations.

          <jats:p>A botnet is a group of hijacked devices that conduct various cyberattacks, which is one of the most dangerous threats on the internet. Organizations or individuals use network traffic to mine botnet communication behavior features. Network traffic often contains individual users’ private information, such as website passwords, personally identifiable information, and communication content. Among the existing botnet detection methods, whether they extract deterministic traffic interaction features, use DNS traffic, or methods based on raw traffic bytes, these methods focus on the detection performance of the detection model and ignore possible privacy leaks. And most methods are combined with machine learning and deep learning technologies, which require a large amount of training data to obtain high-precision detection models. Therefore, preventing malicious persons from stealing data to infer privacy during the botnet detection process has become an issue worth pondering. Based on this problem, this article proposes a privacy-enhanced framework with deep learning for botnet detection. The goal of this framework is to learn a feature extractor. It can hide the private information that the attack model tries to infer from the intermediate anonymity features, while maximally retaining the interactive behavior features contained in the original traffic for botnet detection. We design a privacy confrontation algorithm based on a mutual information calculation mechanism. This algorithm simulates the game between the attacker trying to infer private information through the attack model and the data processor retaining the original content of the traffic to the maximum extent. In order to further ensure the privacy protection of the feature extractor during the training process, we train the feature extractor in the federated learning training mode. We extensively evaluate our approach, validating it on two public datasets and comparing it with existing methods. The results show that our method can effectively ensure detection accuracy on the basis of removing private information. For the CTU-13 dataset, the detection framework achieves the best detection performance; for the ISCX-2014 dataset, the accuracy of the framework is less than 1% lower than the best effect.</jats:p>

          <jats:p>With the growing demand for seamless connectivity and intelligent communication, the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and sixth-generation (6G) communication networks has emerged as a transformative paradigm. By embedding AI capabilities across various network layers, this integration enables optimized resource allocation, improved efficiency, and enhanced system robust performance. This paper presents a comprehensive overview of AI and communication for 6G networks, with a focus on their foundational principles, inherent challenges, and future research opportunities. We first review the integration of AI and communications in the context of 6G, exploring the driving factors behind incorporating AI into wireless communications, as well as the vision for the convergence of AI and 6G. The discourse then transitions to a detailed exposition of the envisioned integration of AI within 6G networks, divided into three progressive stages. The first stage, AI for network, focuses on employing AI to augment network performance, optimize efficiency, and enhance user service experiences. The second stage, network for AI, highlights the role of the network in facilitating and buttressing AI operations and presents key enabling technologies. We compare wireless network large models with conventional large language models (LLMs), and identify key design principles and components for building wireless network architectures. In the final stage, AI as a service, it is anticipated that future 6G networks will innately provide AI functions as services, supporting application scenarios like immersive communication and intelligent industrial robots. Specifically, we define the quality of AI service, which refers to a framework for measuring AI services within the network. We further summarize the standardization process of AI for wireless networks, highlighting key milestones and ongoing efforts. In addition, we analyze the critical challenges faced by the integration of AI and communications in 6G. Finally, we outline promising future research opportunities that are expected to drive the development and refinement of AI and 6G communications.</jats:p>

AB  - The advancement of sensing technologies coupled with the rapid progress in big data analysis has ushered in a new era in intelligent transport and smart city applications. In this context, transportation mode detection (TMD) of mobile users is a field that has gained significant traction in recent years. In this paper, we present a deep learning approach for transportation mode detection using multimodal sensor data elicited from user smartphones. The approach is based on long short-term Memory networks and Bayesian optimization of their parameters. We conducted an extensive experimental evaluation of the proposed approach, which attains very high recognition rates, against a multitude of machine learning approaches, including state-of-the-art methods. We also discuss issues regarding feature correlation and the impact of dimensionality reduction.

AB  - Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a dangerous ailment that can last a person's entire life and is caused by either kidney malignancy or decreased kidney functioning. It is feasible to halt or slow the progression of this chronic disease to an end-stage wherein dialysis or surgical intervention is the only method to preserve a patient's life. Earlier detection and appropriate therapy can increase the likelihood of this happening. Throughout this research, the potential of several different machine learning approaches for providing an early diagnosis of CKD has been investigated. There has been a significant amount of research conducted on this topic. Nevertheless, we are bolstering our approach by making use of predictive modeling. Therefore, in our approach, we investigate the link that exists between data factors as well as the characteristics of the target class. We are capable of constructing a collection of prediction models with the help of machine learning and predictive analytics, thanks to the better measures of attributes that can be introduced using predictive modeling. This study starts with 25 variables in addition to the class property, but by the end, it has narrowed the list down to 30% of those parameters as the best subset to identify CKD. Twelve different machine learning-based classifiers have been tested in a supervised learning environment. Within the confines of a supervised learning environment, a total of 12 different machine learning-based classifiers have indeed been examined, with the greatest performance indicators being an accuracy of 0.983, a precision of 0.98, a recall of 0.98, and an F1-score of 0.98 for the XgBoost classifier. The way the research was done leads to the conclusion that recent improvements in machine learning, along with the help of predictive modeling, make for an interesting way to find new solutions that can then be used to test the accuracy of prediction in the field of kidney disease and beyond.

                     </jats:title><jats:p>We present a novel strategy aimed at restoring correct convergence in complex Langevin simulations. The central idea is to incorporate system-specific prior knowledge into the simulations, in order to circumvent the NP-hard sign problem. In order to do so, we modify complex Langevin using kernels and propose the use of modern auto-differentiation methods to learn optimal kernel values. The optimization process is guided by functionals encoding relevant prior information, such as symmetries or Euclidean correlator data. Our approach recovers correct convergence in the non-interacting theory on the Schwinger-Keldysh contour for any real-time extent. For the strongly coupled quantum anharmonic oscillator we achieve correct convergence up to three-times the real-time extent of the previous benchmark study. An appendix sheds light on the fact that for correct convergence not only the absence of boundary terms, but in addition the correct Fokker-Plank spectrum is crucial.</jats:p>

AB  - Self-association governs the viscosity and solubility of therapeutic antibodies in high-concentration formulations used for subcutaneous delivery, yet it is difficult to reliably identify candidates with low self-association during antibody discovery and early-stage optimization. Here, we report a high-throughput protein engineering method for rapidly identifying antibody candidates with both low self-association and high affinity. We find that conjugating quantum dots to IgGs that strongly self-associate (pH 7.4, PBS), such as lenzilumab and bococizumab, results in immunoconjugates that are highly sensitive for detecting other high self-association antibodies. Moreover, these conjugates can be used to rapidly enrich yeast-displayed bococizumab sub-libraries for variants with low levels of immunoconjugate binding. Deep sequencing and machine learning analysis of the enriched bococizumab libraries, along with similar library analysis for antibody affinity, enabled identification of extremely rare variants with co-optimized levels of low self-association and high affinity. This analysis revealed that co-optimizing bococizumab is difficult because most high-affinity variants possess positively charged variable domains and most low self-association variants possess negatively charged variable domains. Moreover, negatively charged mutations in the heavy chain CDR2 of bococizumab, adjacent to its paratope, were effective at reducing self-association without reducing affinity. Interestingly, most of the bococizumab variants with reduced self-association also displayed improved folding stability and reduced nonspecific binding, revealing that this approach may be particularly useful for identifying antibody candidates with attractive combinations of drug-like properties.<b>Abbreviations:</b> AC-SINS: affinity-capture self-interaction nanoparticle spectroscopy; CDR: complementarity-determining region; CS-SINS: charge-stabilized self-interaction nanoparticle spectroscopy; FACS: fluorescence-activated cell sorting; Fab: fragment antigen binding; Fv: fragment variable; IgG: immunoglobulin; QD: quantum dot; PBS: phosphate-buffered saline; V<sub>H</sub>: variable heavy; V<sub>L</sub>: variable light.

AB  - <AbstractText Label="BACKGROUND" NlmCategory="BACKGROUND">Suicide stands as a global public health concern with a pronounced impact, especially in low- and middle-income countries, where it remains largely unnoticed as a significant health concern, leading to delays in diagnosis and intervention. South Asia, in particular, has seen limited development in this area of research, and applying existing models from other regions is challenging due to cost constraints and the region's distinct linguistics and behavior. Social media analysis, notably on platforms such as Facebook (Meta Platforms Inc), offers the potential for detecting major depressive disorder and aiding individuals at risk of suicidal ideation.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="OBJECTIVE" NlmCategory="OBJECTIVE">This study primarily focuses on India and Bangladesh, both South Asian countries. It aims to construct a predictive model for suicidal ideation by incorporating unique, unexplored features along with masked content from both public and private Facebook profiles. Moreover, the research aims to fill the existing research gap by addressing the distinct challenges posed by South Asia's unique behavioral patterns, socioeconomic conditions, and linguistic nuances. Ultimately, this research strives to enhance suicide prevention efforts in the region by offering a cost-effective solution.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="METHODS" NlmCategory="METHODS">This quantitative research study will gather data through a web-based platform. Initially, participants will be asked a few demographic questions and to complete the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire assessment. Eligible participants who provide consent will receive an email requesting them to upload a ZIP file of their Facebook data. The study will begin by determining whether Facebook is the primary application for the participants based on their active hours and Facebook use duration. Subsequently, the predictive model will incorporate a wide range of previously unexplored variables, including anonymous postings, and textual analysis features, such as captions, biographic information, group membership, preferred pages, interactions with advertisement content, and search history. The model will also analyze the use of emojis and the types of games participants engage with on Facebook.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="RESULTS">The study obtained approval from the scientific review committee on October 2, 2023, and subsequently received institutional review committee ethical clearance on December 8, 2023. Our system is anticipated to automatically detect posts related to depression by analyzing the text and use pattern of the individual with the best accuracy possible. Ultimately, our research aims to have practical utility in identifying individuals who may be at risk of depression or in need of mental health support.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="CONCLUSIONS" NlmCategory="CONCLUSIONS">This initiative aims to enhance engagement in suicidal ideation medical care in South Asia to improve health outcomes. It is set to be the first study to consider predicting participants' primary social application use before analyzing their content to forecast behavior and mental states. The study holds the potential to revolutionize strategies and offer insights for scalable, accessible interventions while maintaining quality through comprehensive Facebook feature analysis.</AbstractText>

                     </jats:title><jats:p>Theoretical interpretations of particle physics data, such as the determination of the Wilson coefficients of the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT), often involve the inference of multiple parameters from a global dataset. Optimizing such interpretations requires the identification of observables that exhibit the highest possible sensitivity to the underlying theory parameters. In this work we develop a flexible open source frame-work, ML4EFT, enabling the integration of unbinned multivariate observables into global SMEFT fits. As compared to traditional measurements, such observables enhance the sensitivity to the theory parameters by preventing the information loss incurred when binning in a subset of final-state kinematic variables. Our strategy combines machine learning regression and classification techniques to parameterize high-dimensional likelihood ratios, using the Monte Carlo replica method to estimate and propagate methodological uncertainties. As a proof of concept we construct unbinned multivariate observables for top-quark pair and Higgs+<jats:italic>Z</jats:italic> production at the LHC, demonstrate their impact on the SMEFT parameter space as compared to binned measurements, and study the improved constraints associated to multivariate inputs. Since the number of neural networks to be trained scales quadratically with the number of parameters and can be fully parallelized, the ML4EFT framework is well-suited to construct unbinned multivariate observables which depend on up to tens of EFT coefficients, as required in global fits.</jats:p>

AB  - Exposure to ionizing radiation disrupts metabolic pathways and causes oxidative stress, which can lead to organ damage. In this study, urinary metabolites from mice exposed to high-dose and low-dose whole-body irradiation (WBI HDR, WBI LDR) or partial-body irradiation (PBI BM2.5) were analyzed using targeted and untargeted metabolomics approaches. Significant metabolic changes particularly in oxidative stress pathways were observed on Day 2 post-radiation. By Day 30, the WBI HDR group showed persistent metabolic dysregulation, while the WBI LDR and PBI BM2.5 groups were similar to control mice. Machine learning models identified metabolites that were predictive of the type of radiation exposure with high accuracy, highlighting their potential use as biomarkers for radiation damage and oxidative stress.

AB  - Non-infectious chronic diseases, especially inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs), hypertension, and diabetes mellitus, are characterized by a prolonged and multisystemic course, and their incidence increases annually, usually causing serious economic burden and psychological stress for patients. Therefore, these diseases deserve scientific and consistent disease management. In addition, the lack of a comprehensive "early disease clues tracking-personalized treatment system-follow-up" model in hospitals also exacerbates this dilemma. Based on these facts, we propose an individualized prediction management system for IBDs based on chronic diseases, focusing on the established IBDs-related prediction models and summarizing their advantages and disadvantages. We call on researchers to pay attention to the integration of models with clinical practice and the continuous correction of models to achieve truly individualized medical treatment for chronic diseases, thus providing substantial value for the rapid diagnosis and adequate treatment of chronic diseases such as IBDs, which follow the "relapse-remission" disease model, and realizing long-term drug use and precise disease management for patients. The goal is to achieve a new level of chronic disease management by scientifically improving long-term medication, precise disease management, and individualized medical treatment, effectively prolonging the remission period and reducing morbidity and disability rates.

        <jats:p>The Expected Goals (xG) is a performance metric used to evaluate a football team’s or a player’s performance. Simply put, it represents the probability of a scoring opportunity that may result in a goal. This metric suits the low-scoring nature of sports such as football. The score of a match involves randomness and inexplicable factors that skew the data represented by standard metrics and often may not represent the actual performance of an individual or a team; therefore, it would be of more significant benefit to individuals trying to analyse a player or a team to use alternative statistics rather than shots on target, ball possessions percentage, and sprints completed. The xG Model is trained on several key metrics derived from on-field events, corroborating with the historical to measure the probability of a shot being a goal by the common goal. The selection of these features, the size and date of the data, and the model used are the parameters that may affect the model’s performance. Using machine learning models to increase the model’s predictive performance decreases the vagueness caused by subjective interpretation. This paper proposes an accurate expected goal model trained on a compiled dataset containing data from the FIFA World Cup 2018 and 2022 and the UEFA Champions League 2018-2022, with a total of 768,744 shots taken by the top players take when representing their country and club on the biggest stage. Moreover, this model is explained by using data visualisation tools to obtain an explainable expected goal representation for evaluating a team or player’s performance. Furthermore, these methods can be generalised to other sports. The xG model also allows us to interpret Expected Results and Expected points scored</jats:p>

AB  - This study applied machine learning (ML) algorithms to predict health-related quality of life (HRQOL) using comprehensive social determinants of health (SDOH) features. Data from the All of Us dataset, comprising participants with complete HRQOL and SDOH records, were analyzed. The primary outcome was HRQOL, which encompassed physical and mental health components, while SDOH features included social, educational, economic, environmental, and healthcare access factors. Three ML algorithms, namely logistic regression, XGBoost, and Random Forest, were tested. The models achieved accuracy ranges of 0.73-0.77 for HRQOL, 0.70-0.71 for physical health, and 0.72-0.77 for mental health, with corresponding area under the curve ranges of 0.81-0.84, 0.74-0.76, and 0.83-0.85, respectively. Emotional stability, activity management, spiritual beliefs, and comorbidity were identified as key predictors. These findings underscore the critical role of SDOH in predicting HRQOL and suggests future research to focus on applying such models to diverse patient populations and specific clinical conditions.

AB  - Research based on traditional linear techniques has yet not been able to clearly identify the role of cognitive skills in reading problems, presumably because the process of reading and the factors that are associated with reading reside within a system of multiple interacting and moderating factors that cannot be captured within traditional statistical models. If cognitive skills are indeed indicative of reading problems, the relatively new nonlinear techniques of machine learning should make better predictions. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether cognitive factors play any role in reading skill, questioning (1) the extent to what cognitive skills are indicative of present reading level, and (2) the extent to what cognitive skills are indicative of future reading progress. In three studies with varying groups of participants (average school-aged and poor readers), the results of four supervised machine learning techniques were compared to the traditional General Linear Models technique. Results of all models appeared to be comparable, producing poor to acceptable results, which are however inadequate for making a thorough prediction of reading development. Assumably, cognitive skills are not predictive of reading problems, although they do correlate with one another. This insight has consequences for scientific theories of reading development, as well as for the prevention and remediation of reading difficulties.

AB  - <jats:p>People and companies today are connected around the world, which has led to a growing importance of the aviation industry. As flight delays are a big challenge in aviation, machine learning algorithms can be used to forecast those. This paper investigates the prediction of the occurrence of flight arrival delays with three prominent machine learning algorithms for a data set of domestic flights in the USA. The task is regarded as a classification problem. The focus lies on the investigation of the influence of short-term features on the quality of the results. Therefore, three scenarios are created that are characterised by different input feature sets. When forgoing the inclusion of short-term information in order to shift the prediction timing to an early point in time, an accuracy of 69.5% with a recall of 68.2% is achieved. By including information on the delay that the aircraft had on its previous flight, the prediction quality increases slightly. Hence, this is a compromise between the early prediction timing of the first model and the good prediction quality of the third model, where the departure delay of the aircraft is added as an input feature. In this case, an accuracy of 89.9% with a recall of 83.4% is obtained. The desired timing of prediction therefore determines which features to use as inputs since short-term features significantly improve the prediction quality.</jats:p>

          <jats:p>This study analyzes socio-economic demographics (including Geomatic conzoom® segmented demographic variables) as well as building and property registration information as risk factors in relation to the prevalence of residential building fires within 100 m × 100 m cells. The logistic regression model achieved a receiver operating curve (ROC) of 0.74 and a precision-recall curve of 0.12 on the testing dataset. The model identifies 19 significant variables related to the risk of residential fire. The top 5 highest performing variables in our model and their odds ratios are the following: number of people (OR 1.25), Multi/family residence-building type (OR 1.20), number of buildings (OR 1.18), conzoom® Type C—Country/Rural Communities (OR 0.85), construction year (OR 0.87). These results indicate that socio-economic factors play a large role in influencing fire vulnerability within residential areas and can help prioritize resource allocation to reduce fire vulnerability in the identified risk factor groups.</jats:p>

AB  - In data assimilation, observations are fused with simulations to obtain an accurate estimate of the state and parameters for a given physical system. Combining data with a model, however, while accurately estimating uncertainty, is computationally expensive and infeasible to run in real-time for complex systems. Here, we present a novel particle filter methodology, the Deep Latent Space Particle filter or D-LSPF, that uses neural network-based surrogate models to overcome this computational challenge. The D-LSPF enables filtering in the low-dimensional latent space obtained using Wasserstein AEs with modified vision transformer layers for dimensionality reduction and transformers for parameterized latent space time stepping. As we demonstrate on three test cases, including leak localization in multi-phase pipe flow and seabed identification for fully nonlinear water waves, the D-LSPF runs orders of magnitude faster than a high-fidelity particle filter and 3-5 times faster than alternative methods while being up to an order of magnitude more accurate. The D-LSPF thus enables real-time data assimilation with uncertainty quantification for the test cases demonstrated in this paper.

At low momentum transfers (<jats:italic>Q</jats:italic><jats:sup>2</jats:sup> ≲ few GeV<jats:sup>2</jats:sup>), inelastic structure functions are however affected by large uncertainties which distort event rate predictions for neutrino energies <jats:italic>E</jats:italic><jats:sub><jats:italic>ν</jats:italic></jats:sub> up to the TeV scale. Here we present a determination of neutrino inelastic structure functions valid for the complete range of energies relevant for phenomenology, from the GeV region entering oscillation analyses to the multi-EeV region accessible at neutrino telescopes. Our NNSF<jats:italic>ν</jats:italic> approach combines a machine-learning parametrisation of experimental data with pQCD calculations based on state-of-the-art analyses of proton and nuclear parton distributions (PDFs). We compare our determination to other calculations, in particular to the popular Bodek-Yang model. We provide updated predictions for inclusive cross sections for a range of energies and target nuclei, including those relevant for LHC far-forward neutrino experiments such as FASER<jats:italic>ν</jats:italic>, SND@LHC, and the Forward Physics Facility. The NNSF<jats:italic>ν</jats:italic> determination is made available as fast interpolation LHAPDF grids, and it can be accessed both through an independent driver code and directly interfaced to neutrino event generators such as GENIE.</jats:p>

AB  - <jats:p>Predictive Process Monitoring (PPM) has been integrated into process mining use cases as a value-adding task. PPM provides useful predictions on the future of the running business processes with respect to different perspectives, such as the upcoming activities to be executed next, the final execution outcome, and performance indicators. In the context of PPM, Machine Learning (ML) techniques are widely employed. In order to gain trust of stakeholders regarding the reliability of PPM predictions, eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) methods have been increasingly used to compensate for the lack of transparency of most of predictive models. Multiple XAI methods exist providing explanations for almost all types of ML models. However, for the same data, as well as, under the same preprocessing settings or same ML models, generated explanations often vary significantly. Corresponding variations might jeopardize the consistency and robustness of the explanations and, subsequently, the utility of the corresponding model and pipeline settings. This paper introduces a framework that enables the analysis of the impact PPM-related settings and ML-model-related choices may have on the characteristics and expressiveness of the generated explanations. Our framework provides a means to examine explanations generated either for the whole reasoning process of an ML model, or for the predictions made on the future of a certain business process instance. Using well-defined experiments with different settings, we uncover how choices made through a PPM workflow affect and can be reflected through explanations. This framework further provides the means to compare how different characteristics of explainability methods can shape the resulting explanations and reflect on the underlying model reasoning process.</jats:p>

AB  - The integration of IoT systems into automotive vehicles has raised concerns associated with intrusion detection within these systems. Vehicles equipped with a controller area network (CAN) control several systems within a vehicle where disruptions in function can lead to significant malfunctions, injuries, and even loss of life. Detecting disruption is a primary concern as vehicles move to higher degrees of autonomy and the possibility of self-driving is explored. Tackling cyber-security challenges within CAN is essential to improve vehicle and road safety. Standard differences between different manufacturers make the implementation of a discreet system difficult; therefore, data-driven techniques are needed to tackle the ever-evolving landscape of cyber security within the automotive field. This paper examines the possibility of using machine learning classifiers to identify cyber assaults in CAN systems. To achieve applicability, we cover two classifiers: extreme gradient boost and K-nearest neighbor algorithms. However, as their performance hinges on proper parameter selection, a modified metaheuristic optimizer is introduced as well to tackle parameter optimization. The proposed approach is tested on a publicly available dataset with the best-performing models exceeding 89% accuracy. Optimizer outcomes have undergone rigorous statistical analysis, and the best-performing models were subjected to analysis using explainable artificial intelligence techniques to determine feature impacts on the best-performing model.

AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Sparse rewards and sample efficiency are open areas of research in the field of reinforcement learning. These problems are especially important when considering applications of reinforcement learning to robotics and other cyber-physical systems. This is so because in these domains many tasks are goal-based and naturally expressed with binary successes and failures, action spaces are large and continuous, and real interactions with the environment are limited. In this work, we propose Deep Value-and-Predictive-Model Control (DVPMC), a model-based predictive reinforcement learning algorithm for continuous control that uses system identification, value function approximation and sampling-based optimization to select actions. The algorithm is evaluated on a dense reward and a sparse reward task. We show that it can match the performance of a predictive control approach to the dense reward problem, and outperforms model-free and model-based learning algorithms on the sparse reward task on the metrics of sample efficiency and performance. We verify the performance of an agent trained in simulation using DVPMC on a real robot playing the reach-avoid game.

          <AbstractText Label="Materials and methods" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">This research was triggered by the need to answer the medical problem of when will an asymptomatic ATTRv patient show symptoms of the disease. To do so, we defined and studied the impact of 77 features (ranging from demographic and genealogical to familial disease history) we studied and compared a pool of prediction algorithms, namely, linear regression (LR), elastic net (EN), lasso (LA), ridge (RI), support vector machines (SV), decision tree (DT), random forest (RF), and XGboost (XG), both in a classification as well as a regression setting; we assembled a baseline (BL) which corresponds to the current medical knowledge of the disease; we studied the problem of predicting the age of onset of ATTRv patients; we assessed the viability of predicting age of onset on short term horizons, with a classification framing, on localized sets of patients (currently symptomatic and asymptomatic carriers, with and without genealogical information); and we compared the results with an out-of-bag evaluation set and assembled in a different time-frame than the original data in order to account for data leakage.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="Results" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">Currently, we observe that our approach outperforms the BL model, which follows a set of clinical heuristics and represents current medical practice. Overall, our results show the supremacy of SV and XG for both the prediction tasks although impacted by data characteristics, namely, the existence of missing values, complex data, and small-sized available inputs.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="Discussion" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">With this study, we defined a predictive model approach capable to be well-understood by medical professionals, compared with the current practice, namely, the baseline approach (BL), and successfully showed the improvement achieved to the current medical knowledge.</AbstractText>

AB  - <jats:p>With the rapid development of social economy, the competition of human resources is becoming more and more fierce. Recruitment, as the main way for enterprises to obtain talents, determines the future development of enterprises to a great extent. Compared with Western advanced countries, the research on recruitment in China started late, the overall research level is relatively backward, and most of the relevant technical means and analytical methods are introduced from advanced countries. The existing literature is still relatively scattered, which is not conducive to the rapid development of recruitment direction research, and is not conducive to specific applications. Starting with the existing deep learning, from four models, that is, based on the traditional machine learning model, conditional random field (CRF), deep learning models Bi-LSTM-CRF, BERT, and BERT-Bi-LSTM-CRF identify and automatically extract recruitment entities and study recruitment accordingly; BERT-Bi-LSTM-CRF-BERT and BERT-BiLSTM-CRF are the models with the worst recognition effect. Although they have stronger text feature extraction ability and context information capture ability, they are limited by the small scale of information science recruitment corpus and the small number of entities, so their performance under this task is not brought into full play. Although CRF is relatively traditional, it can still achieve excellent results on some small-scale sparse datasets.</jats:p>

AB  - In response to past climatic changes, the species with different habits or adaptive traits likely have experienced very different evolutionary histories, especially for species that restricted to high mountain areas. In order to trace how Quaternary climatic oscillations affected range distributions and intraspecific divergence of such alpine plants on the Tibetan Plateau, here, we investigated maternally inherited chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) markers and biparentally inherited nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) DNA variations and aimed to explore the phylogeographic history of the endemic alpine species Corydalis hendersonii Hemsl. (Papaveraceae). We sequenced four cpDNA fragments (trnS-trnG, trnT-trnL, atpH-atpI, and psbE-petL) and also the nuclear (ITS) region in 368 individuals from 30 populations across the species' range. The network and phylogenetic analysis based on cpDNA variations identified 15 chlorotypes that cluster into three distinct clades. However, our nuclear DNA results demonstrated that there were four genetic/geographical groups within C. hendersonii. Some common and highly divergent cpDNA and ITS haplotypes were distributed in the populations of central and northeastern Tibetan Plateau, and the highest nucleotide diversity and genetic differentiation were detected in the central region. Demographic tests further indicated that the populations of southwestern and western Tibet may have experienced recent range expansion, which most likely occurred during the last glacial maximum (LGM) and continued its expansion after the beginning of the Holocene. These two different groups of this species may have derived from potential refugia that existed in the central and/or northeastern regions of Tibet during recent interglacial periods. In addition, our AMOVA analyses detected high genetic differentiation along with the whole sampling range. Also, distinct phylogeographic structures were detected among populations of C. hendersonii based on both of cpDNA and ITS variation. These findings shed new light on the importance of climatic oscillations during Quaternary and complex local topography as causes of intraspecific diversification and demographic changes within cold-tolerant herbs in the Tibetan Plateau biodiversity hotspot.

AB  - Rapid progress has been witnessed for human-object interaction (HOI) recognition, but most existing models are confined to single-stage reasoning pipelines. Considering the intrinsic complexity of the task, we introduce a cascade architecture for a multi-stage, coarse-to-fine HOI understanding. At each stage, an instance localization network progressively refines HOI proposals and feeds them into an interaction recognition network. Each of the two networks is also connected to its predecessor at the previous stage, enabling cross-stage information propagation. The interaction recognition network has two crucial parts: a relation ranking module for high-quality HOI proposal selection and a triple-stream classifier for relation prediction. With our carefully-designed human-centric relation features, these two modules work collaboratively towards effective interaction understanding. Further beyond relation detection on a bounding-box level, we make our framework flexible to perform fine-grained pixel-wise relation segmentation; this provides a new glimpse into better relation modeling. Our approach reached the 1 st place in the ICCV2019 Person in Context Challenge, on both relation detection and segmentation tasks. It also shows promising results on V-COCO.

AB  - In this research paper, the spatial distributions of five different services-Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP), Video Conferencing (VC), Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), and Electronic Mail-are investigated using three different approaches: circular, random, and uniform approaches. The amount of each service varies from one to another. In certain distinct settings, which are collectively referred to as mixed applications, a variety of services are activated and configured at predetermined percentages. These services run simultaneously. Furthermore, this paper has established a new algorithm to assess both the real-time and best-effort services of the various IEEE 802.11 technologies, describing the best networking architecture as either a Basic Service Set (BSS), an Extended Service Set (ESS), or an Independent Basic Service Set (IBSS). Due to this fact, the purpose of our research is to provide the user or client with an analysis that suggests a suitable technology and network configuration without wasting resources on unnecessary technologies or requiring a complete re-setup. In this context, this paper presents a network prioritization framework for enabling smart environments to determine an appropriate WLAN standard or a combination of standards that best supports a specific set of smart network applications in a specified environment. A network QoS modeling technique for smart services has been derived for assessing best-effort HTTP and FTP, and the real-time performance of VoIP and VC services enabled via IEEE 802.11 protocols in order to discover more optimal network architecture. A number of IEEE 802.11 technologies have been ranked by using the proposed network optimization technique with separate case studies for the circular, random, and uniform geographical distributions of smart services. The performance of the proposed framework is validated using a realistic smart environment simulation setting, considering both real-time and best-effort services as case studies with a range of metrics related to smart environments.

AB  - <jats:p>In this study, we explore the possibility of monitoring program cell death (apoptosis) and classifying clusters of apoptotic cells based on the changes in high frequency ultrasound backscatter signals from these cells. One of the hallmarks of cancer is that the fail [sic] in the apoptosis mechanism in cells. Therefore this research carries the promise of designing more refined and more effective cancer therapies.     The ultrasound signals are modeled through the Autoregressive (AR) modeling technique. The proper model order is calculated by tracking the error criteria derived from statistical properties of the original and modeled signal. In the next stage, five machine learning classifiers are developed to classify backscatter signals based on their AR coefficients.     In clinical applications ultrasound backscatter signals from tissues and tumors are most likely to be non-stationary. Therefore analyzing such signals requires signal segmentation techniques. We developed recursive least square lattice filter for adaptive segmentation of ultrasound backscatter signals from multiple cell types into blocks of stationary segments, and model and classify the segments individually.     In this thesis we demonstrate the accuracy of modeling, segmentation and classification techniques to detect signals from different cell pellets based on the signal processing and machine learning techniques.</jats:p>

        <p><bold>Purpose</bold>Heart failure is a complex clinical condition when the heart cannot provide blood with enough flow for the body's needs.  It is a major clinical and public health problem. Even if heart failure is not yet diagnosed, it is important to get your health checked every three to six months. This study aims to improve the accuracy of diagnosing heart failure by using machine learning classifiers such as Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) and Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE). <bold>Methods</bold>Heart failure data has been acquired from the University of California, Irvine (UCI) repository. To improve the accuracy of diagnosing heart failure, we employed the following methods for this study: k-Nearest Neighbor, Naive Bayes (NB), Random Forest, XGBoost, Decision Tree (DT), Logistic Regression (LR), and Support Vector Machines (SVM). The model was validated using the F-measure and ROC-AUC (Receiver Characteristic Area Under Curve) methods. <bold>Results</bold>Support vector machines employing logistic regression as a feature selection strategy produced the most significant classification accuracy of 90%, while support vector machines utilising RF as a feature selection strategy showed an accuracy of 83%. We also have an accuracy of 90% in the random forest as a machine learning methodology with all of our features.<bold>Conclusion</bold>The small dataset size of the current research presents a challenge to everyone's ability to gain more accurate findings. Improved diagnostics for heart failure may be possible in the future using our machine-learning classifier-based classification system. To accurately forecast heart failure, this is the easiest way to use and the most accurate.</p>

AB  - Football is one of the most popular sports worldwide. Football fans, in their pursuit of maximizing enjoyment from supporting their favorite teams, are eager to know the outcome of ongoing matches. However, related studies to predict football match outcomes have focused on predicting them before the match starts, using measures from previous match data. Therefore, we propose a method to predict the outcome of an ongoing match at any time during the game as one of three classes: home win, away win, or draw. We focus on the event of passes, the most fundamental unit of movement in football, and have been shown in many studies to influence match outcomes. Unlike previous studies that used generalized aggregated variables such as total pass counts for pass information, we propose a graph-based classification model that directly utilizes the dynamically changing passing network as a graph. Our proposed graph-based model effectively leverages information about the location of each pass and the players attempting these passes from the passing network. As a result, in experiments predicting the final outcome at the 45, 60, 75, and 90-minute marks, our model outperformed baseline models that used general pass measures. Furthermore, by additionally incorporating non-pass event information, our model achieved a performance improvement of 5 to 20% across various classes compared to using only the passing network. This study holds substantial implications for integrating graph theory and graph modeling into the domain of football, highlighting the impact of passing information on outcome prediction.

AB  - The recognition of membership function by knowledge acquisition from experts is an important factor for many fuzzy mathematical programming models. Thus, the hesitant fuzzy membership function (HFMF) estimation could help users of the mathematical programming approaches to provide a powerful solution in continuous space problems. Therefore, this study proposes a possibilistic programming approach based on Bezier curve mechanism for estimating the HFMF. In the process of possibilistic programming approach, an optimization model is presented to tune the primary parameters of Bezier curve by the goal of minimizing the sum of the squared errors (SSE) between the empirical data and fitted HFMF. After that, the efficiency and applicability of the proposed approach is checked by proposing a novel mathematical model for biomass supply chain network design problem. In this case, the bio-products demand is declared as an imprecise parameter that follows from the estimated HFMF to increase the accuracy of the obtained results by addressing the uncertainty and unreliability of the information. Finally, a computational experiment and validation procedure about the biomass supply chain network design is provided to peruse the verification and validation of the proposed approaches.

AB  - <jats:p>The past decade has seen an increasing interest in designing sophisticated density functional approximations (DFAs) by integrating the power of machine learning (ML) techniques. However, application of the ML-based DFAs is often confined to simple model systems. In this work, we construct an ML correction to the widely used Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) functional by establishing a semilocal mapping from the electron density and reduced gradient to the exchange-correlation energy density. The resulting ML-corrected PBE is immediately applicable to any real molecule, and yields significantly improved heats of formation while preserving the accuracy for other thermochemical and kinetic properties. This work highlights the prospect of combining the power of data-driven ML methods with physics-inspired derivations for reaching the heaven of chemical accuracy.</jats:p>

AB  - <jats:p>Infrared detectors and focal plane array technologies are becoming ubiquitous in military, but are limited in the commercial sectors. The widespread commercial use of this technology is lacking because of the high cost and large size, weight and power. Most of these detectors require cryogenic cooling to minimize thermally generated dark currents, causing the size, weight, power and cost to increase significantly. Approaches using very thin detector design can minimize thermally generated dark current, but at a cost of lower absorption efficiency. There are emerging technologies in nanostructured material designs such as metasurfaces that can allow for increased photon absorption in a thin detector architecture. Ultra-thin and low-dimensional absorber materials may also provide unique engineering opportunities in detector design. This chapter discusses the physics and opportunities to increase the operating temperature using such techniques.</jats:p>

AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Phylogenomic analyses routinely estimate species trees using methods that account for gene tree discordance. However, the most scalable species tree inference methods, which summarize independently inferred gene trees to obtain a species tree, are sensitive to hard-to-avoid errors introduced in the gene tree estimation step. This dilemma has created much debate on the merits of concatenation versus summary methods and practical obstacles to using summary methods more widely and to the exclusion of concatenation. The most successful attempt at making summary methods resilient to noisy gene trees has been contracting low support branches from the gene trees. Unfortunately, this approach requires arbitrary thresholds and poses new challenges. Here, we introduce threshold-free weighting schemes for the quartet-based species tree inference, the metric used in the popular method ASTRAL. By reducing the impact of quartets with low support or long terminal branches (or both), weighting provides stronger theoretical guarantees and better empirical performance than the original ASTRAL. More consequentially, weighting dramatically improves accuracy in a wide range of simulations and reduces the gap with concatenation in conditions with low gene tree discordance and high noise. On empirical data, weighting improves congruence with concatenation and increases support. Together, our results show that weighting, enabled by a new optimization algorithm we introduce, dramatically improves the utility of summary methods and can reduce the incongruence often observed across analytical pipelines.</jats:p>

AB  - With the dramatic increase in video surveillance applications and public safety measures, the need for an accurate and effective system for abnormal/suspicious activity classification also increases. Although it has multiple applications, the problem is very challenging. In this paper, a novel approach for detecting normal/abnormal activity has been proposed. We used the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) and Kalman filter to detect and track the objects, respectively. After that, we performed shadow removal to segment an object and its shadow. After object segmentation we performed occlusion detection method to detect occlusion between multiple human silhouettes and we implemented a novel method for region shrinking to isolate occluded humans. Fuzzy c-mean is utilized to verify human silhouettes and motion based features including velocity and optical flow are extracted for each identified silhouettes. Gray Wolf Optimizer (GWO) is used to optimize feature set followed by abnormal event classification that is performed using the XG-Boost classifier. This system is applicable in any surveillance application used for event detection or anomaly detection. Performance of proposed system is evaluated using University of Minnesota (UMN) dataset and UBI (University of Beira Interior)-Fight dataset, each having different type of anomaly. The mean accuracy for the UMN and UBI-Fight datasets is 90.14% and 76.9% respectively. These results are more accurate as compared to other existing methods.

AB  - <AbstractText Label="BACKGROUND">There is no specific treatment for sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) manifesting as pulseless electric activity (PEA) and survival rates are low; unlike ventricular fibrillation (VF), which is treatable by defibrillation. Development of novel treatments requires fundamental clinical studies, but access to the true initial rhythm has been a limiting factor.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="METHODS">Using demographics and detailed clinical variables, we trained and tested an AI model (extreme gradient boosting) to differentiate PEA-SCA versus VF-SCA in a novel setting that provided the true initial rhythm. A subgroup of SCAs are witnessed by emergency medical services personnel, and because the response time is zero, the true SCA initial rhythm is recorded. The internal cohort consisted of 421 emergency medical services-witnessed out-of-hospital SCAs with PEA or VF as the initial rhythm in the Portland, Oregon metropolitan area. External validation was performed in 220 emergency medical services-witnessed SCAs from Ventura, CA.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="RESULTS">In the internal cohort, the artificial intelligence model achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.68 (95% CI, 0.61-0.76). Model performance was similar in the external cohort, achieving an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.72 (95% CI, 0.59-0.84). Anemia, older age, increased weight, and dyspnea as a warning symptom were the most important features of PEA-SCA; younger age, chest pain as a warning symptom and established coronary artery disease were important features associated with VF.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="CONCLUSIONS">The artificial intelligence model identified novel features of PEA-SCA, differentiated from VF-SCA and was successfully replicated in an external cohort. These findings enhance the mechanistic understanding of PEA-SCA with potential implications for developing novel management strategies.</AbstractText>

        <p>Covid-19 is a virus that affects both animals and people and is quickly expanding. This deadly illness affects people's daily lives, health, and economy. The most significant imaging methods for detecting COVID-19 are a computed tomography (CT) scan and chest X-ray. For this epidemic, all researchers are striving for efficient solutions and quick treatment approaches. Fast and accurate automated detection approaches have been introduced to eliminate the requirement for medical professionals. This work proposes an efficient SqueezeNet for Covid classification to solve this challenge. Inception V3 is employed to extract some of the most important features. SqueezeNet is optimized by Deer Hunt Optimization algorithm (DHO) to improve the performance. From chest x-ray images, a multi-classification DL approach for diagnosing COVID-19, pneumonia, normal, and tuberculosis is proposed. The proposed categorization strategy is implemented in Python and compared to other approaches. In terms of f1-score, sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy experiments have shown that the proposed method outperforms other recent and state-of-the-art methodologies.</p>

AB  - Background: Breast cancer, behind skin cancer, is the second most frequent malignancy among women, initiated by an unregulated cell division in breast tissues. Although early mammogram screening and treatment result in decreased mortality, differentiating cancer cells from surrounding tissues are often fallible, resulting in fallacious diagnosis. Method: The mammography dataset is used to categorize breast cancer into four classes with low computational complexity, introducing a feature extraction-based approach with machine learning (ML) algorithms. After artefact removal and the preprocessing of the mammograms, the dataset is augmented with seven augmentation techniques. The region of interest (ROI) is extracted by employing several algorithms including a dynamic thresholding method. Sixteen geometrical features are extracted from the ROI while eleven ML algorithms are investigated with these features. Three ensemble models are generated from these ML models employing the stacking method where the first ensemble model is built by stacking ML models with an accuracy of over 90% and the accuracy thresholds for generating the rest of the ensemble models are >95% and >96. Five feature selection methods with fourteen configurations are applied to notch up the performance. Results: The Random Forest Importance algorithm, with a threshold of 0.045, produces 10 features that acquired the highest performance with 98.05% test accuracy by stacking Random Forest and XGB classifier, having a higher than >96% accuracy. Furthermore, with K-fold cross-validation, consistent performance is observed across all K values ranging from 3−30. Moreover, the proposed strategy combining image processing, feature extraction and ML has a proven high accuracy in classifying breast cancer.

Second, we carry out a SMEFT interpretation of the same dataset using state-of-the-art SM and EFT theory cal- culations, resulting in bounds on 25 Wilson coefficients modifying top quark interactions. Subsequently, we integrate the two analyses within the SIMUnet approach to realise a simul- taneous determination of the SMEFT PDFs and the EFT coefficients and identify regions in the parameter space where their interplay is most phenomenologically relevant. We also demonstrate how to separate eventual BSM signals from QCD effects in the interpretation of top quark measurements at the LHC.</jats:p>

          <jats:p>Recently, deep neural networks (DNNs) have become powerful tools for solving inverse scattering problems. However, the approximation and generalization rates of DNNs for solving these problems remain largely under-explored. In this work, we introduce two types of combined DNNs (uncompressed and compressed) to reconstruct two function-valued coefficients in the Helmholtz equation for inverse scattering problems from the scattering data at two different frequencies. An analysis of the approximation and generalization capabilities of the proposed neural networks for simulating the regularized pseudo-inverses of the linearized forward operators in direct scattering problems is provided. The results show that, with sufficient training data and parameters, the proposed neural networks can effectively approximate the inverse process with desirable generalization. Preliminary numerical results show the feasibility of the proposed neural networks for recovering two types of isotropic inhomogeneous media. Furthermore, the trained neural network is capable of reconstructing the isotropic representation of certain types of anisotropic media.</jats:p>

AB  - The last two decades brought an explosion of computational tools and processes in many scientific domains (e.g., life-, social- and geo-science). Scientific workflows, i.e., computational pipelines, accompanied by workflow management systems, were soon adopted as a de-facto standard among non-computer scientists for orchestrating such computational processes. The goal of this ... read more dissertation is to provide a framework that would automate the orchestration of such computational pipelines in practice. We refer to such problems as scientific workflow synthesis problems. This dissertation introduces the temporal logic SLTLx, and presents a novel SLTLx-based synthesis approach that overcomes limitations in handling data object dependencies present in existing synthesis approaches. The new approach uses transducers and temporal goals, which keep track of the data objects in the synthesised workflow. The proposed SLTLx-based synthesis includes a bounded and a dynamic variant, which are shown in Chapter 3 to be NP-complete and PSPACE-complete, respectively. Chapter 4 introduces a transformation algorithm that translates the bounded SLTLx-based synthesis problem into propositional logic. The transformation is implemented as part of the APE (Automated Pipeline Explorer) framework, presented in Chapter 5. It relies on highly efficient SAT solving techniques, using an off-the-shelf SAT solver to synthesise a solution for the given propositional encoding. The framework provides an API (application programming interface), a CLI (command line interface), and a web-based GUI (graphical user interface). The development of APE was accompanied by four concrete application scenarios as case studies for automated workflow composition. The studies were conducted in collaboration with domain experts and presented in Chapter 6. Each of the case studies is used to assess and illustrate specific features of the SLTLx-based synthesis approach. (1) A case study on cartographic map generation demonstrates the ability to distinguish data objects as a key feature of the framework. It illustrates the process of annotating a new domain, and presents the iterative workflow synthesis approach, where the user tries to narrow down the desired specification of the problem in a few intuitive steps. (2) A case study on geo-analytical question answering as part of the QuAnGIS project shows the benefits of using data flow dependencies to describe a synthesis problem. (3) A proteomics case study demonstrates the usability of APE as an “off-the-shelf” synthesiser, providing direct integration with existing semantic domain annotations. In addition, a manual evaluation of the synthesised results shows promising results even on large real-life domains, such as the EDAM ontology and the complete bio.tools registry. (4) A geo-event question-answering study demonstrates the usability of APE within a larger question-answering system. This dissertation answers the goals it sets to solve. It provides a formal framework, accompanied by a lightweight library, which can solve real-life scientific workflow synthesis problems. Finally, the development of the library motivated an upcoming collaborative project in the life sciences domain. The aim of the project is to develop a platform which would automatically compose (using APE) and benchmark workflows in computational proteomics. show less

AB  - The Exon Junction Complex (EJC) deposited upstream of exon-exon junctions during pre-mRNA splicing in the nucleus remains stably bound to RNA to modulate mRNA fate at multiple post-transcriptional steps until its disassembly during translation. Here, we investigated two EJC disassembly mechanisms in human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells, one mediated by PYM1, a factor that can bind both the ribosome and the RBM8A/MAGOH heterodimer of the EJC core, and another by the elongating ribosome itself. We find that EJCs lacking PYM1 interaction show no defect in translation-dependent disassembly but is required for translation-independent EJC destabilization. Surprisingly, PYM1 interaction deficient EJCs are enriched on sites away from the canonical EJC binding position including on transcripts without introns or with fewer and longer exons. Acute reduction of PYM1 levels in HEK293 cells results in a modest inhibition of nonsense-mediated mRNA decay and stabilization of mRNAs that localize to endoplasmic reticulum associated TIS-granules and are characterized by fewer and longer exons. We confirmed the previously reported PYM1-flavivirus capsid protein interaction and found that human cells expressing the capsid protein or infected with flaviviruses show similar changes in gene expression as upon PYM1 depletion. Thus, PYM1 acts as an EJC specificity factor that is hijacked by flaviviruses to alter global EJC occupancy and reshape host cell mRNA regulation.

AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>A review presents the state-of-the-art path-following control systems for maritime autonomous surface ships, where the special focus is placed on the guidance subsystem and control subsystem. The path following control system is one of the basic requirements for autonomous ships since it guarantees that the ship can track the predefined path with small cross-track errors. The path following problem is firstly defined, and the cross-track error dynamics are derived from the kinematic equations of marine surface ships. The classical guidance laws are introduced, and the governing equations are also presented in this paper. A review of the guidance laws and controllers for the maritime autonomous surface ships has been carried out based on relevant journal and conference papers. Several important properties and characteristics, such as control structure, guidance law, control method, stability, environmental disturbance and vessel dynamics, are defined for the comparative analysis. Finally, the summary and a discussion on the most used technologies for the path following control of marine autonomous surface ships are presented and highlighted.</jats:p>

AB  - <p>Several parallel trends, including the growing number of Internet reliant devices/services, increasing Internet penetration rates, and the continuing popularity of bandwidth-hungry multimedia content contribute to the exponential surge of Internet traffic. The combination of these trends could imply a considerable increase in network infrastructure investment for the telecom and broadband operators. In addition, the high cost of initial investment could escalate the market barriers to entry for the innovative service providers incapable of deploying their own network infrastructure. In this dissertation, we explore if and how enabling optical access network sharing could cultivate new network ownership and business models that simultaneously keep the end-user subscription fees low and facilitate the market entry for the smaller service providers. We aim to identify and address the technological and economic barriers of optical access network sharing. The broad scope of this dissertation concerns the inter-operator sharing of optical access networks which connect the end-users to the operators' network in the last-mile. The access segment of the communications network is recognized to be the most costly due to its deployment scale. Therefore, a reduction in cost in the access will have a multi-fold impact on the overall capital expenditure for network deployments. The dissertation focuses in particular on PONs as the most widespread type of optical access networks. The central argument of the present research is that network infrastructure/resource sharing has the potential to reduce the capital and operational expenditure of the network operators. This will allow for more competition as the market entrance cost decreases. We first address the lack of tenant operators' adequate control over the shared resources in a multi-tenant PON as a technological barrier. We provide a solution to strengthen the network operators' control over their share of the network in a multi-tenant PON. This is made possible by allowing the operators to schedule the transmission over the network using tailored algorithms to meet their requirements (e.g., latency and throughput). The dissertation argues that providing a virtual (software) instance of the DBA algorithm as opposed to the inflexible hardware implementation first enables the coexistence of various services on the PON and second, improves the overall utilization of the network capacity. While the virtualization of the DBA removes the technical barrier for the inter-operator resource sharing, it does not come with a natural incentive for the operators to share their resources with competitors. Therefore we tackle the lack of incentive for sharing excess network capacity in PON by providing monetary compensation in return for sharing. We model the multi-tenant optical access network with multiple coexisting operators as a market where they can exchange their excess capacity. We propose a sealed-bid multi-item double auction to enable capacity trading between the network operators. Through mathematical proof and market simulation/visualization, we prove that the proposed auction mechanism meets the essential requirements for an economic robust market mechanism (e.g., incentive compatibility, individual rationality, and budget balance). This provides trusted market conduct in the presence of a central authority (e.g., the public infrastructure provider) that all the operators trust.</p>

AB  - <jats:p>Intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring (IONM) is being applied to a wide range of surgical fields as a diagnostic tool to protect patients from neural injuries that may occur during surgery. However, several contributing factors complicate the interpretation of IONM, and it is labor- and training-intensive. Meanwhile, machine learning (ML)-based medical research has been growing rapidly, and many studies on the clinical application of ML algorithms have been published in recent years. Despite this, the application of ML to IONM remains limited. Major challenges in applying ML to IONM include the presence of non-surgical contributing factors, ambiguity in the definition of false-positive cases, and their inter-rater variability. Nevertheless, we believe that the application of ML enables objective and reliable IONM, while overcoming the aforementioned problems that experts may encounter. Large-scale, standardized studies and technical considerations are required to overcome certain obstacles to the use of ML in IONM in the future.</jats:p>

AB  - Motivated by factors such as the reduction in cost and the need for a shift towards achieving UN's Sustainable Development Goals, PV (Photovoltaic) power generation is getting more attention in the cold regions of the Nordic countries and Canada. The cold climate and the albedo effect of snow in these regions present favorable operating conditions for PV cells and an opportunity to realize the seasonal matching of generation and consumption respectively. However, the erratic nature of PV brings a threat to the operation of the grid. PV power forecasting has been used as an economical solution to minimize and even overcome this limitation. This paper is therefore a comprehensive review of machine learning-based PV output power forecasting models in the literature in the context of Nordic climate. The impact of meteorological parameters and the soiling effect due to snow, which is unique to this climate, on the performance of a prediction model is discussed. PV power forecasting models in the literature are systematically classified into multiple groups and each group is analyzed and important suggestions are made for choosing a better model for these regions. Ensemble methods, optimization algorithms, time-series decomposition, and weather clustering are identified as important techniques that can be used to enhance performance. And notably, this work proposed two conceptual approaches that can be used to incorporate the effect of snow on PV power forecasting. Future research needs to focus on this area, which is crucial for the development of PV in these regions.

AB  - People can use credit cards for online transactions as it provides an efficient and easy-to-use facility. With the increase in usage of credit cards, the capacity of credit card misuse has also enhanced. Credit card frauds cause significant financial losses for both credit card holders and financial companies. In this research study, the main aim is to detect such frauds, including the accessibility of public data, high-class imbalance data, the changes in fraud nature, and high rates of false alarm. The relevant literature presents many machines learning based approaches for credit card detection, such as Extreme Learning Method, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, Logistic Regression and XG Boost. However, due to low accuracy, there is still a need to apply state of the art deep learning algorithms to reduce fraud losses. The main focus has been to apply the recent development of deep learning algorithms for this purpose. Comparative analysis of both machine learning and deep learning algorithms was performed to find efficient outcomes. The detailed empirical analysis is carried out using the European card benchmark dataset for fraud detection. A machine learning algorithm was first applied to the dataset, which improved the accuracy of detection of the frauds to some extent. Later, three architectures based on a convolutional neural network are applied to improve fraud detection performance. Further addition of layers further increased the accuracy of detection. A comprehensive empirical analysis has been carried out by applying variations in the number of hidden layers, epochs and applying the latest models. The evaluation of research work shows the improved results achieved, such as accuracy, f1-score, precision and AUC Curves having optimized values of 99.9%,85.71%,93%, and 98%, respectively. The proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art machine learning and deep learning algorithms for credit card detection problems. In addition, we have performed experiments by balancing the data and applying deep learning algorithms to minimize the false negative rate. The proposed approaches can be implemented effectively for the real-world detection of credit card fraud.

AB  - <jats:p>Supply chain demand forecasting is a strategic process aimed at predicting future customer demand for products within the broader framework of a supply chain. This involves forecasting the anticipated quantity of goods or services that customers will purchase and seamlessly integrating this insight into the overall supply chain management. The primary goal is to synchronize production, procurement, and distribution activities with expected demand, thereby optimizing inventory costs, minimizing instances of under stocking or overstocking, reducing waste, and ultimately enhancing overall supply chain efficiency. The emphasis is on leveraging advanced technologies, including deep learning techniques such as CNN, LSTM, CNN+LSTM, GRU, and machine learning techniques like Linear Regression and XGBoost, to achieve accurate predictions. By implementing these algorithms, businesses can construct a robust forecasting system capable of monitoring changes in demand and aligning supply accordingly. This proactive approach empowers retailers to enhance their inventory and planning efficiency, ultimately contributing to increased customer satisfaction.

AB  - <jats:p>Twitter is one of the most popular social networks attracting millions of users, while a considerable proportion of online discourse is captured. It provides a simple usage framework with short messages and
an efficient application programming interface (API) enabling the research community to study and analyze several aspects of this social network. However, the Twitter usage simplicity can lead to malicious
handling by various bots. The malicious handling phenomenon expands in online discourse, especially during the electoral periods, where except the legitimate bots used for dissemination and communication
purposes, the goal is to manipulate the public opinion and the electorate towards a certain direction, specific ideology, or political party. This paper focuses on the design of a novel system for identifying
Twitter bots based on labeled Twitter data. To this end, a supervised machine learning (ML) framework is adopted using an Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) algorithm, where the hyper-parameters are tuned via cross-validation.

Our study also deploys Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) for explaining the ML model predictions by calculating feature importance, using the game theoretic-based Shapley values.
Experimental evaluation on distinct Twitter datasets demonstrate the superiority of our approach, in terms of bot detection accuracy, when compared against a recent state-of-the-art Twitter bot detection method.</jats:p>

        <jats:p>In late December 2019, the novel coronavirus (Sars-Cov-2) and the resulting disease COVID-19 were first identified in Wuhan China. The disease slipped through containment measures, with the first known case in the United States being identified on January 20th, 2020. In this paper, we utilize survey data from the Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research and apply several statistical and machine learning models and techniques such as Decision Trees, Multinomial Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, k-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machines, Neural Networks, Random Forests, Gradient Tree Boosting, XGBoost, CatBoost, LightGBM, Synthetic Minority Oversampling, and Chi-Squared Test to analyze the impacts the COVID-19 pandemic has had on the mental health of frontline workers in the United States. Through the interpretation of the many models applied to the mental health survey data, we have concluded that the most important factor in predicting the mental health decline of a frontline worker is the healthcare role the individual is in (Nurse, Emergency Room Staff, Surgeon, etc.), followed by the amount of sleep the individual has had in the last week, the amount of COVID-19 related news an individual has consumed on average in a day, the age of the worker, and the usage of alcohol and cannabis.</jats:p>

AB  - Nucleate boiling is important in nuclear applications and cooling applications under earth gravity conditions. Under reduced gravity or microgravity environment, it is significant too, especially in space exploration applications. Although multiple studies have been performed on nucleate boiling, the effect of gravity on nucleate boiling is not well understood. This dissertation primarily deals with numerical simulations of nucleate boiling using an adaptive Moment-of-Fluid (MoF) method for a single vapor bubble (water vapor or Perfluoro-n-hexane) in saturated liquid for different gravity levels. Results concerning the growth rate of the bubble, specifically the departure diameter and departure time have been provided. The MoF method has been first validated by comparing results with a theoretical solution of vapor bubble growth in superheated liquid without any heat transfer from the wall. Next, bubble growth rate and heat transfer results under earth gravity, reduced gravity, and micro-gravity conditions are reported and they are in good agreement with experiments. A new method is proposed for estimating the bubble diameter at different gravity levels. This method is based on an analysis of empirical data at different gravity values and uses power-series curve fitting to obtain a generalized bubble growth curve irrespective of the gravity value. This method is shown to provide a good estimate of the bubble diameter for a specific gravity value and time. A new hybrid approach is proposed for calculating the contribution of the depletable liquid micro-layer trapped between the vapor bubble and the heater wall for numerical simulations in microgravity conditions is proposed in this work. This technique does not ``model'' the micro-layer, but calculates the contribution of the vapor flux from the micro-layer into the bubble and distributes it over the cells where the micro-layer should be present. The micro-layer is depletable because an evaporation term is part of the equation which maintains the reduction in the thickness of the micro-layer consistent with the behavior reported in experiments. Results for nucleate boiling simulations under micro-gravity conditions are reported using the proposed micro-layer approach in comparison with experiments performed on the International Space Station. Results for bubble growth rate, bubble shape, and heat-flux are in good agreement with experiments and are verified with two different time instants in the bubble life cycle. Additionally, a data-driven model is proposed for the prediction of heat-flux from experimental parameters like wall super-heat, gravity, liquid sub-cooling, etc. Experimental data from multiple experiments under varying conditions for different liquids have been performed to date. Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) have been used to predict nucleate boiling heat flux by learning from a dataset of twelve experimental parameters across 231 independent samples. An approach to reduce the number of parameters involved is proposed to increase model accuracy. The approach consists of two steps. In the first step, a feature importance study is performed to determine the most significant parameters. Only important features are used in the second step. In the second step, dimensional analysis is performed on these important parameters. Neural network analysis is then conducted based on the dimensionless parameters. The results indicate that the proposed feature importance study and dimensional analysis can significantly improve ANN performance. The results show that model errors based on the reduced dataset are considerably lower than those based on the initial dataset. The study based on other machine learning models also shows the reduced dataset generates better results. The results also show that ANN outperforms other machine learning algorithms and outperforms a well-known boiling correlation equation. The effect of parameters on heatflux has been quantified, and the effect of parameters on different physical sub-processes in nucleate boiling has been analyzed. The effect of parameters on the boiling regimes has also been investigated. Additionally, the feature importance study concludes that wall superheats, gravity and liquid subcooling are the three most significant parameters in the prediction of heat flux for nucleate boiling.

AB  - Rechargeable batteries currently hold the largest share of the electrochemical energy storage market, and they play a major role in the sustainable energy transition and industrial decarbonization to respond to global climate change. Due to the increased popularity of consumer electronics and electric vehicles, lithium-ion batteries have quickly become the most successful rechargeable batteries in the past three decades, yet growing demands in diversified application scenarios call for new types of rechargeable batteries. Tremendous efforts are made to developing the next-generation post-Li-ion rechargeable batteries, which include, but are not limited to solid-state batteries, lithium–sulfur batteries, sodium-/potassium-ion batteries, organic batteries, magnesium-/zinc-ion batteries, aqueous batteries and flow batteries. Despite the great achievements, challenges persist in precise understandings about the electrochemical reaction and charge transfer process, and optimal design of key materials and interfaces in a battery. This roadmap tends to provide an overview about the current research progress, key challenges and future prospects of various types of rechargeable batteries. New computational methods for materials development, and characterization techniques will also be discussed as they play an important role in battery research.

AB  - In this work, we introduced COFInformatics, a computational approach merging molecular simulations and machine learning (ML) algorithms, to evaluate all synthesized and hypothetical covalent organic frameworks (COFs) for the CO<sub>2</sub>/CH<sub>4</sub> mixture separation under four different adsorption-based processes: pressure swing adsorption (PSA), vacuum swing adsorption (VSA), temperature swing adsorption (TSA), and pressure-temperature swing adsorption (PTSA). We first extracted structural, chemical, energy-based, and graph-based molecular fingerprint features of every single COF structure in the very large COF space, consisting of nearly 70,000 materials, and then performed grand canonical Monte Carlo simulations to calculate the CO<sub>2</sub>/CH<sub>4</sub> mixture adsorption properties of 7540 COFs. These features and simulation results were used to develop ML models that accurately and rapidly predict CO<sub>2</sub>/CH<sub>4</sub> mixture adsorption and separation properties of all 68,614 COFs. The most efficient separation process and the best adsorbent candidates among the entire COF spectrum were identified and analyzed in detail to reveal the most important molecular features that lead to high-performance adsorbents. Our results showed that (i) many hypoCOFs outperform synthesized COFs by achieving higher CO<sub>2</sub>/CH<sub>4</sub> selectivities; (ii) the top COF adsorbents consist of narrow pores and linkers comprising aromatic, triazine, and halogen groups; and (iii) PTSA is the most efficient process to use COF adsorbents for natural gas purification. We believe that COFInformatics promises to expedite the evaluation of COF adsorbents for CO<sub>2</sub>/CH<sub>4</sub> separation, thereby circumventing the extensive, time- and resource-intensive molecular simulations.

AB  - Photoelectrocatalytic (PEC) production of fuels and chemicals by using solar energy, water, and CO 2 paves a promising avenue toward carbon neutrality. Over the past decades, for accelerating this process, a variety of photocathodes have been explored. Among them, the hybrid of GaN nanowires (NWs) and planar silicon has appeared as a disruptive platform for this grand topic, owing to their distinctive structural, optoelectronic, and catalytic properties. This review illustrates the most recent advances in GaN NWs/Si-based photocathodes for CO 2 reduction reactions powered by simulated sunlight, beginning with a discussion of the critical requirements and fundamental challenges of PEC CO 2 reduction. The characteristics of GaN NWs/Si are then discussed, showing its great potential in precisely controlling the behavior of photons, charges, and chemical species. As the focus of this review, the progress on the PEC CO 2 reduction reactions toward different products over GaN NWs/Si-based photocathodes is highlighted. In the end, the challenges and prospects of GaN NWs/Si-based photocathodes for the practical synthesis of solar fuels and chemicals are proposed.

AB  - Diabetes is one of the most common and serious diseases affecting human health. Early diagnosis and treatment are vital to prevent or delay complications related to diabetes. An automated diabetes detection system assists physicians in the early diagnosis of the disease and reduces complications by providing fast and precise results. This study aims to introduce a technique based on a combination of multiple linear regression (MLR), random forest (RF), and XGBoost (XG) to diagnose diabetes from questionnaire data. MLR-RF algorithm is used for feature selection, and XG is used for classification in the proposed system. The dataset is the diabetic hospital data in Sylhet, Bangladesh. It contains 520 instances, including 320 diabetics and 200 control instances. The performance of the classifiers is measured concerning accuracy (ACC), precision (PPV), recall (SEN, sensitivity), F1 score (F1), and the area under the receiver-operating-characteristic curve (AUC). The results show that the proposed system achieves an accuracy of 99.2%, an AUC of 99.3%, and a prediction time of 0.04825 seconds. The feature selection method improves the prediction time, although it does not affect the accuracy of the four compared classifiers. The results of this study are quite reasonable and successful when compared with other studies. The proposed method can be used as an auxiliary tool in diagnosing diabetes.

AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Metabolism plays a central role in evolution, as resource conservation is a selective pressure for fitness and survival. Resource-driven adaptations offer a good model to study evolutionary innovation more broadly. It remains unknown how resource-driven optimization of genome function integrates chromatin architecture with transcriptional phase transitions. Here we show that tuning of genome architecture and heterotypic transcriptional condensates mediate resilience to nutrient limitation. Network genomic integration of phenotypic, structural, and functional relationships reveals that fat tissue promotes organismal adaptations through metabolic acceleration chromatin domains and heterotypic PGC1A condensates. We find evolutionary adaptations in several dimensions; low conservation of amino acid residues within protein disorder regions, nonrandom chromatin location of metabolic acceleration domains, condensate-chromatin stability through cis-regulatory anchoring and encoding of genome plasticity in radial chromatin organization. We show that environmental tuning of these adaptations leads to fasting endurance, through efficient nuclear compartmentalization of lipid metabolic regions, and, locally, human-specific burst kinetics of lipid cycling genes. This process reduces oxidative stress, and fatty-acid mediated cellular acidification, enabling endurance of condensate chromatin conformations. Comparative genomics of genetic and diet perturbations reveal mammalian convergence of phenotype and structural relationships, along with loss of transcriptional control by diet-induced obesity. Further, we find that radial transcriptional organization is encoded in functional divergence of metabolic disease variant-hubs, heterotypic condensate composition, and protein residues sensing metabolic variation. During fuel restriction, these features license the formation of large heterotypic condensates that buffer proton excess, and shift viscoelasticity for condensate endurance. This mechanism maintains physiological pH, reduces pH-resilient inflammatory gene programs, and enables genome plasticity through transcriptionally driven cell-specific chromatin contacts. In vivo manipulation of this circuit promotes fasting-like adaptations with heterotypic nuclear compartments, metabolic and cell-specific homeostasis. In sum, we uncover here a general principle by which transcription uses environmental fluctuations for genome function, and demonstrate how resource conservation optimizes transcriptional self-organization through robust feedback integrators, highlighting obesity as an inhibitor of genome plasticity relevant for many diseases.</jats:p>

AB  - Predictive business process monitoring (PPM) has been around for several years as a use case of process mining. PPM enables foreseeing the future of a business process through predicting relevant information about how a running process instance might end, related performance indicators, and other predictable aspects. A big share of PPM approaches adopts a Machine Learning (ML) technique to address a prediction task, especially non-process-aware PPM approaches. Consequently, PPM inherits the challenges faced by ML approaches. One of these challenges concerns the need to gain user trust in the predictions generated. The field of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) addresses this issue. However, the choices made, and the techniques employed in a PPM task, in addition to ML model characteristics, influence resulting explanations. A comparison of the influence of different settings on the generated explanations is missing. To address this gap, we investigate the effect of different PPM settings on resulting data fed into an ML model and consequently to a XAI method. We study how differences in resulting explanations may indicate several issues in underlying data. We construct a framework for our experiments including different settings at each stage of PPM with XAI integrated as a fundamental part. Our experiments reveal several inconsistencies, as well as agreements, between data characteristics (and hence expectations about these data), important data used by the ML model as a result of querying it, and explanations of predictions of the investigated ML model.

AB  - Medicinal plant diversity (MPD) is an important component of plant diversity. Over-collection based on medicinal and economic value has the potential to damage the stability of the regional ecosystem. It is important to understand the current distribution of MPD and the factors influencing it. However, it is still unclear whether environmental and socioeconomic conditions have an impact on their distribution. We selected the Inner Mongolia as a representative study area which covers a wide area, accounting for 12.29% of China's national land area and 0.79% of the world's land area. At the same time, the region is a long-standing traditional medicinal area for Mongolians in China. Therefore, the region is significantly influenced by changes in environmental factors and socio-economic factors. We used 9-years field survey of the distribution of medicinal plants in Inner Mongolia for assessing the distribution of MPD as influenced by environmental and socioeconomic activities by combining spatial analyses, species distribution models, and generalized additive models. The results from the spatial analysis show that the western region of Inner Mongolia is the main cold spot area of the MPD, and the central-eastern and northeastern regions of Inner Mongolia are the main hot spot areas of the MPD. At the same time, the distribution of cold spots and hot spots of MPD is more obvious at large spatial scales, and with the refinement of spatial scales, the cold spots in scattered areas are gradually revealed, which is indicative for the conservation and development of MPD at different spatial scales. Under the future climate change of shared socioeconomic pathways (SSP), areas with high habitat suitability for medicinal plants remain mainly dominated by the Yellow River, Yin Mountains, and Greater Khingan Range. Notably, the SSP245 development pathway remains the most significant concern in either long- or short-term development. The nonlinear relationship between the driving factors of MPD at different spatial scales shows that temperature, precipitation and socioeconomic development do have complex effects on MPD. The presence of a certain temperature, altitude, and precipitation range has an optimal facilitation effect on MPD, rather than a single facilitation effect. This complex nonlinear correlation provides a reference for further studies on plant diversity and sustainable development and management. In this study, the spatial distribution of medicinal plant resources and the extent to which they are driven by ecological and socioeconomic factors were analyzed through a macroscopic approach. This provides a reference for larger-scale studies on the environmental and socioeconomic influences on the distribution of plant resources.

AB  - This paper proposes an artificial neural network (ANN)-based synthesis method for nonuniform linear arrays with mutual coupling effects. The proposed method can simultaneously optimize the location distributions and excitations of the elements. As is well known, for nonuniform linear arrays, the mutual coupling effects on the active element patterns (AEPs) and passive S parameters vary with the location distribution of the elements. However, few papers have focused on how to describe the relationship between the effects of mutual coupling and the location distribution of the elements. In this paper, we use several parallel and independent ANNs to characterize the effects of mutual coupling on the AEPs and passive S parameters in nonuniform linear arrays with variable location distributions. At the same time, to relieve the curse of dimensionality, we make use of the idea of subarrays, which makes it possible for the proposed method to model nonuniform linear arrays with a large number of elements. After building accurate ANN models, we make use of the adaptive differential evolution algorithm JADE to search for the optimal location distribution and the excitations of the elements, to satisfy the requirements for the radiation pattern and the active S parameters of the antenna array. In view of the fact that the mutual coupling effects are accounted for in the synthesis process, the proposed method probably exhibits more practical value in antenna array designs than in other synthesis methods. The validity and efficiency of the proposed method are confirmed based on three examples.

AB  - (1) Background: Surgical cytoreduction for epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is a complex procedure. Encompassed within the performance skills to achieve surgical precision, intra-operative surgical decision-making remains a core feature. The use of eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) could potentially interpret the influence of human factors on the surgical effort for the cytoreductive outcome in question; (2) Methods: The retrospective cohort study evaluated 560 consecutive EOC patients who underwent cytoreductive surgery between January 2014 and December 2019 in a single public institution. The eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) and Deep Neural Network (DNN) algorithms were employed to develop the predictive model, including patient- and operation-specific features, and novel features reflecting human factors in surgical heuristics. The precision, recall, F1 score, and area under curve (AUC) were compared between both training algorithms. The SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) framework was used to provide global and local explainability for the predictive model; (3) Results: A surgical complexity score (SCS) cut-off value of five was calculated using a Receiver Operator Characteristic (ROC) curve, above which the probability of incomplete cytoreduction was more likely (area under the curve [AUC] = 0.644; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.598−0.69; sensitivity and specificity 34.1%, 86.5%, respectively; p = 0.000). The XGBoost outperformed the DNN assessment for the prediction of the above threshold surgical effort outcome (AUC = 0.77; 95% [CI] 0.69−0.85; p < 0.05 vs. AUC 0.739; 95% [CI] 0.655−0.823; p < 0.95). We identified “turning points” that demonstrated a clear preference towards above the given cut-off level of surgical effort; in consultant surgeons with <12 years of experience, age <53 years old, who, when attempting primary cytoreductive surgery, recorded the presence of ascites, an Intraoperative Mapping of Ovarian Cancer score >4, and a Peritoneal Carcinomatosis Index >7, in a surgical environment with the optimization of infrastructural support. (4) Conclusions: Using XAI, we explain how intra-operative decisions may consider human factors during EOC cytoreduction alongside factual knowledge, to maximize the magnitude of the selected trade-off in effort. XAI techniques are critical for a better understanding of Artificial Intelligence frameworks, and to enhance their incorporation in medical applications.

AB  - Melanoma is a severe skin cancer that involves abnormal cell development. This study aims to provide a new feature fusion framework for melanoma classification that includes a novel 'F' Flag feature for early detection. This novel 'F' indicator efficiently distinguishes benign skin lesions from malignant ones known as melanoma. The article proposes an architecture that is built in a Double Decker Convolutional Neural Network called DDCNN future fusion. The network's deck one, known as a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), finds difficult-to-classify hairy images using a confidence factor termed the intra-class variance score. These hirsute image samples are combined to form a Baseline Separated Channel (BSC). By eliminating hair and using data augmentation techniques, the BSC is ready for analysis. The network's second deck trains the pre-processed BSC and generates bottleneck features. The bottleneck features are merged with features generated from the ABCDE clinical bio indicators to promote classification accuracy. Different types of classifiers are fed to the resulting hybrid fused features with the novel 'F' Flag feature. The proposed system was trained using the ISIC 2019 and ISIC 2020 datasets to assess its performance. The empirical findings expose that the DDCNN feature fusion strategy for exposing malignant melanoma achieved a specificity of 98.4%, accuracy of 93.75%, precision of 98.56%, and Area Under Curve (AUC) value of 0.98. This study proposes a novel approach that can accurately identify and diagnose fatal skin cancer and outperform other state-of-the-art techniques, which is attributed to the DDCNN 'F' Feature fusion framework. Also, this research ascertained improvements in several classifiers when utilising the 'F' indicator, resulting in the highest specificity of + 7.34%.

AB  - Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) underpin the concept of Mobility as a Service (MaaS), which requires universal and seamless users' access across multiple public and private transportation systems while allowing operators' proportional revenue sharing. Current user sensing technologies such as Walk-in/Walk-out (WIWO) and Check-in/Check-out (CICO) have limited scalability for large-scale deployments. These limitations prevent ITS from supporting analysis, optimization, calculation of revenue sharing, and control of MaaS comfort, safety, and efficiency. We focus on the concept of implicit Be-in/Be-out (BIBO) smartphone-sensing and classification. To close the gap and enhance smartphones towards MaaS, we developed a proprietary smartphone-sensing platform collecting contemporary Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) signals from BLE devices installed on buses and Global Positioning System (GPS) locations of both buses and smartphones. To enable the training of a model based on GPS features against the BLE pseudo-label, we propose the Cause-Effect Multitask Wasserstein Autoencoder (CEMWA). CEMWA combines and extends several frameworks around Wasserstein autoencoders and neural networks. As a dimensionality reduction tool, CEMWA obtains an auto-validated representation of a latent space describing users' smartphones within the transport system. This representation allows BIBO clustering via DBSCAN. We perform an ablation study of CEMWA's alternative architectures and benchmark against the best available supervised methods. We analyze performance's sensitivity to label quality. Under the na\"ive assumption of accurate ground truth, XGBoost outperforms CEMWA. Although XGBoost and Random Forest prove to be tolerant to label noise, CEMWA is agnostic to label noise by design and provides the best performance with an 88\% F1 score.

AB  - <jats:p>&lt;p&gt;Fifth-generation and beyond (5G and xG) wireless networks are envisioned to meet the requirements of various vertical applications that require higher traffic throughput, ultra-massive connectivity, extremely low latency, and high quality of service. Disruptive technologies, such as massive multiple-input multiple-output, millimeter wave, and multiple access are being deployed to meet these requirements. However, the deployment of these technologies poses several challenges, including the lack of network transparency, management decentralization, and reliability. In addition, the heterogeneity of these networks raises security concerns, particularly, confidentiality, privacy, and trustworthiness. Typically, networks rely on encryption techniques at higher layers to ensure  security and privacy. However, due to the emergence of novel computing paradigms, such as quantum computing, traditional security approaches are no longer sufficient to protect over-the-air communications. Therefore, 5G/xG networks must consider smarter and more efficient security techniques to operate seamlessly and efficiently. Within this context, physical layer security (PLS) and blockchain represent promising solutions to complement existing methods. By exploiting the characteristics of wireless links, PLS can enhance the security of wireless communications, while blockchain can guarantee the decentralization, integrity, and trustworthiness of networks. Motivated by these technological advancements, this paper provides an in-depth review of the existing literature on PLS and blockchain. Then, for the first time, we present a framework for the integration of PLS with blockchain in 5G/xG  systems. We begin by providing a thorough discussion about the potential of PLS and blockchain for 5G/xG systems. Next, we present our vision of a cross-layer architecture that leverages both PLS and blockchain in 5G/xG networks. Finally, we identify related challenges and open issues and shed light on future research directions.&lt;/p&gt;

AB  - <jats:p>Debris flows, triggered by dual interferences extrinsically and intrinsically, have been widespread in China. The debris-flow susceptibility (DFS) assessment is acknowledged as the benchmark for the mitigation and prevention of debris flow risks, but DFS assessments at the national level are lacking. The role of human activities in the DFS assessment has always been overlooked. On the basis of a detailed inventory of debris-flow sites and a large set of environmental and human-related characteristics, this research presents the comparative performance of the well-known information value (IV), logistic regression (LR) and random forest (RF) models for DFS assessments in China. Twelve causative factors, namely, elevation, slope, aspect, rainfall, the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), land use, landform, geology, distance to faults, density of villages, distance to rivers and distance to roads, were considered. Debris-flow susceptibility maps were then generated after the nonlinear relationship between the debris-flow occurrence and the causative factors was captured. Finally, the predictive performance of the three maps was evaluated through receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, and the validation results showed that areas under the ROC curves were 81.98%, 79.96% and 97.38% for the IV, LR and RF models, respectively, indicating that the RF model outperformed the other two traditional statistical methods. The importance ranking of the RF model also revealed that distance to roads, slope and rainfall dominated the spatial distribution of debris flows. This is the first experiment to compare between the traditional statistical and machine learning methods in DFS studies for the whole of China. Our results could provide some empirical support for China’s policymakers and local practitioners in their efforts to enable residents to be less vulnerable to disasters.</jats:p>

AB  - <jats:p>This article reviews the issue of the use of cryptocurrencies (crypto-assets, in general) for an electricity settlement system. The development of digital techniques, including blockchain-based mechanisms, has meant that an increased interest in blockchain-based solutions is to be expected. Blockchain and similar approaches are characterised by decentralisation, so they are concurrent with the trends of the transforming power sector. Decentralised energy generation based on a high proportion of prosumer installations requires the implementation of a new settlement system for grid activities related to electricity use. The first projects of such systems based on a dedicated cryptocurrency have emerged. Based on these, the general concept of such a system with its own cryptocurrency called CCE is presented, including variants implementing net-metering and net-billing. Furthermore, issues requiring interdisciplinary research work and discussion before implementing such systems were identified. A settlement system in which a cryptocurrency is linked to a unit of energy used could be a first step towards introducing a new universal means of value exchange, linked to energy as the primary measure of the value of goods.</jats:p>

AB  - <jats:p>Short-term precipitation prediction through abundant observation data (ground observation station data, radar data, etc.) is an essential part of the contemporary meteorological prediction system. However, most current studies only use single-modal data, which leads to some problems, such as poor prediction accuracy and little prediction timeliness. This paper proposes a multimodal data fusion precipitation prediction model integrating station data and radar data. Specifically, our model consists of three parts. Firstly, the radar feature encoder comprises a shallow convolution neural network and a stacked convolutional long short term memory network (ConvLSTM), which is used to extract the spatio-temporal features of radar-echo data. The weather station data feature encoder is composed of a fully connected network and an LSTM, which is used to extract the sequential features of the weather station data. Then, the cross-modal feature encoder obtains cross-modal features by aligning and exchanging the feature information of the radar data and the weather station data through the cross-attention mechanism. Finally, the decoder outputs the quantitative short-term precipitation prediction value. Our model can integrate station and radar data characteristics and improve prediction accuracy and timeliness, and can flexibly add other modal features. We have verified our model on four short-term and impending rainfall datasets in South Eastern China, achieving the best performance among the algorithms.</jats:p>
