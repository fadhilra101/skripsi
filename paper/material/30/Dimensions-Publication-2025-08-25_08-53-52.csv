pub.1189229990,10.3389/fspor.2025.1569155,Mapping football tactical behavior and collective dynamics with artificial intelligence: a systematic review,"Football, as a dynamic and complex sport, demands an understanding of tactical behaviors to excel in training and competition. Artificial intelligence (AI) has revolutionized the tactical performance analysis in football, offering unprecedented data analytics insights for players, coaches, and analysts. This systematic review aims to examine and map out the current state of research on AI-based tactical behavior, collective dynamics, and movement patterns in football. A total of 2,548 articles were identified following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines and the Population-Intervention-Comparators-Outcomes framework. By synthesizing findings from 32 studies, this review elucidates the available AI-based techniques to analyze tactical behavior and identify the collective dynamic based on artificial neural networks, deep learning, machine learning, and time-series techniques. Concretely, the tactical behavior was expressed by spatiotemporal tracking data using convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks, variational recurrent neural networks, and variational autoencoders, Delaunay method, player rank, hierarchical clustering, logistic regression, XGBoost, random forest classifier, repeated incremental pruning produce error reduction, principal component analysis, and T-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding. Furthermore, collective dynamics and patterns were mapped by graph metrics such as betweenness centrality, eccentricity, efficiency, vulnerability, clustering coefficient, and page rank, expected possession value, pitch control map classifier, computer vision techniques, expected goals, 3D ball trajectories, dangerousity assessment, pass probability model, and total passes attempted. The performance of technical-tactical key indicators was expressed by team possession, team formation, team strategy, team-space control efficiency, determining team formations, coordination patterns, analyzing player interactions, ball trajectories, and pass effectiveness. In conclusion, the AI-based models can effectively reshape the landscape of spatiotemporal tracking data into training and practice routines with real-time decision-making support, performance prediction, match management, tactical-strategic thinking, and training task design. Nevertheless, there are still challenges for the real practical application of AI-based techniques, as well as ethical regulation and the formation of professional profiles that combine sports science, data analytics, computer science, and coaching expertise.",Frontiers in Sports and Active Living,2025,7,,1569155,"Teixeira, José E.; Maio, Eduardo; Afonso, Pedro; Encarnação, Samuel; Machado,

pub.1181865072,10.1371/journal.pone.0312278,Predicting goal probabilities with improved xG models using event sequences in association football,"In association football, predicting the likelihood and outcome of a shot at a goal is useful but challenging. Expected goal (xG) models can be used in a variety of ways including evaluating performance and designing offensive strategies. This study proposed a novel framework that uses the events preceding a shot, to improve the accuracy of the expected goals (xG) metric. A combination of previously explored and unexplored temporal features is utilized in the proposed framework. The new features include; ""advancement factor"", and ""player position column"". A random forest model was used, which performed better than published single-event-based models in the literature. Results further demonstrated a significant improvement in model performance with the inclusion of preceding event information. The proposed framework and model enable the discovery of event sequences that improve xG, which include; opportunities built up from the sides of the 18-yard box, shots attempted from in front of the goal within the opposition's 18-yard box, and shots from successful passes to the far post.",PLOS ONE,2024,19,10,e0312278,"Bandara, Ishara; Shelyag, Sergiy; Rajasegarar, Sutharshan; Dwyer, Dan; Kim, Eun-jin; Angelova, Maia",Aston University; Bulgarian Academy of Sciences; Coventry University; Deakin University; Flinders University,Australia; Bulgaria; United Kingdom,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1181865072,3,[]|[]|PLOS ONE|2016|11|12|e0168768|10.1371/journal.pone.0168768|pub.1026968426|111;[]|[]|IEEE Access|2024|12||83363-83376|10.1109/access.2024.3413648|pub.1172816556|3;[]|[]|European Journal of Operational Research|2020|283|2|726-736|10.1016/j.ejor.2019.11.026|pub.1122911797|57;[]|[]|PLOS ONE|2021|16|8|e0255407|10.1371/journal.pone.0255407|pub.1140178695|43;[]|[]|European Journal of Applied Physiology|2015|116|2|373-382|10.1007/s00421-015-3293-7|pub.1019183597|9;[]|[]|Journal of Sports Economics|2020|21|4|335-362|10.1177/1527002519897962|pub.1124267545|62;[]|[]|Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association|2022|29|9|1525-1534|10.1093/jamia/ocac093|pub.1148557752|212;[]|[]|IEEE Access|2020|8||90266-90279|10.1109/access.2020.2992025|pub.1127358337|21;[]|[]|Journal of Sports Science and Medicine|2010|9|2|288-93||pub.1078802707|256;[]|[]|Journal of the Royal Statistical Society Series A (General)|1968|131|4|581-585|10.2307/2343726|pub.1103088303|234;[]|[]|Frontiers in Sports and Active Living|2021|3||676179|10.3389/fspor.2021.676179|pub.1139725536|17;[]|[]|PLOS ONE|2012|7|11|e47678|10.1371/journal.pone.0047678|pub.1007586282|30;[]|[]|EPL (Europhysics Letters)|2010|89|3|38007|10.1209/0295-5075/89/38007|pub.1043167559|76;[]|[]|Frontiers in Sports and Active Living|2021|3||624475|10.3389/fspor.2021.624475|pub.1136743813|93;[]|[]|Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing|2023|1448||126-129|10.1007/978-3-031-31772-9_27|pub.1160650971|4;[]|[]|Scientific Data|2019|6|1|236|10.1038/s41597-019-0247-7|pub.1122140166|177;[]|[]|Journal of the Royal Statistical Society Series D (The Statistician)|1997|46|4|541-550|10.1111/1467-9884.00108|pub.1014061448|124;[]|[]|International Journal of Performance Analysis in Sport|2014|14|1|307-329|10.1080/24748668.2014.11868723|pub.1092924537|38;[]|[]|arXiv|2022||||10.48550/arxiv.2206.07212|pub.1148728488|2;[]|[]|PLOS ONE|2023|18|4|e0282295|10.1371/journal.pone.0282295|pub.1157010510|41;[]|[]|arXiv|2023||||10.48550/arxiv.2308.15559|pub.1163709232|1;[]|[]|Journal of the Royal Statistical Society Series A (General)|1971|134|4|623-629|10.2307/2343657|pub.1103088563|78;[]|[]|Omega|2009|37|1|63-78|10.1016/j.omega.2006.08.002|pub.1049007411|90;[]|[]|Journal of Applied Science and Technology Trends|2021|2|02|133-140|10.38094/jastt204112|pub.1144220924|6;[]|[]|Journal of Sports Sciences|2010|28|3|237-244|10.1080/02640410903502774|pub.1012306059|182;[]|[]|Communications in Computer and Information Science|2023|1783||27-40|10.1007/978-3-031-27527-2_3|pub.1155713308|2;[]|[]|Journal of Sports Sciences|2012|31|6|639-676|10.1080/02640414.2012.746720|pub.1023035100|357
pub.1136743813,10.3389/fspor.2021.624475,A Goal Scoring Probability Model for Shots Based on Synchronized Positional and Event Data in Football (Soccer),"Due to the low scoring nature of football (soccer), shots are often used as a proxy to evaluate team and player performances. However, not all shots are created equally and their quality differs significantly depending on the situation. The aim of this study is to objectively quantify the quality of any given shot by introducing a so-called expected goals (xG) model. This model is validated statistically and with professional match analysts. The best performing model uses an extreme gradient boosting algorithm and is based on hand-crafted features from synchronized positional and event data of 105, 627 shots in the German Bundesliga. With a ranked probability score (RPS) of 0.197, it is more accurate than any previously published expected goals model.

pub.1152500934,10.3390/s22218474,xLength: Predicting Expected Ski Jump Length Shortly after Take-Off Using Deep Learning,"With tracking systems becoming more widespread in sports research and regular training and competitions, more data are available for sports analytics and performance prediction. We analyzed 2523 ski jumps from 205 athletes on five venues. For every jump, the dataset includes the 3D trajectory, 3D velocity, skis' orientation, and metadata such as wind, starting gate, and ski jumping hill data. Using this dataset, we aimed to predict the expected jump length (xLength) inspired by the expected goals metric in soccer (xG). We evaluate the performance of a fully connected neural network, a convolutional neural network (CNN), a long short-term memory (LSTM), and a ResNet architecture to estimate the xLength. For the prediction of the jump length one second after take-off, we achieve a mean absolute error (MAE) of 5.3 m for the generalization to new athletes and an MAE of 5.9 m for the generalization to new ski jumping hills using ResNet architectures. Additionally, we investigated the influence of the input time after the take-off on the predictions' accuracy. As expected, the MAE becomes smaller with longer inputs. Due to the real-time transmission of the sensor's data, xLength can be updated during the flight phase and used in live TV broadcasting. xLength could also be used as an analysis tool for experts to quantify the quality of the take-off and flight phases.",Sensors,2022,22,21,8474,"Link, Johannes; Schwinn, Leo; Pulsmeyer, Falk; Kautz, Thomas; Eskofier, Bjoern M",University of Erlangen-Nuremberg,Germany,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1152500934,2,[]|[]|Journal of Biomechanics|2005|38|11|2157-2163|10.1016/j.jbiomech.2004.10.004|pub.1040411526|58;[]|[]|Multimedia Tools and Applications|2011|60|3|641-667|10.1007/s11042-011-0833-y|pub.1029229553|65;[]|[]|Neural Computation|1997|9|8|1735-1780|10.1162/neco.1997.9.8.1735|pub.1038140272|77837;[]|[]|Journal of Applied Biomechanics|1995|11|2|224-237|10.1123/jab.11.2.224|pub.1062423490|52;[]|[]|Journal of Biomechanics|2009|42|8|1095-1101|10.1016/j.jbiomech.2009.02.026|pub.1010941344|53;[]|[]|Journal of Biomechanics|1996|29|8|1061-1068|10.1016/0021-9290(95)00169-7|pub.1007115500|70;[]|[]|2017 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR)|2017|||1302-1310|10.1109/cvpr.2017.143|pub.1095837104|6123;[]|[]|Proceedings of the ACM on Interactive Mobile Wearable and Ubiquitous Technologies|2017|1|3|1-17|10.1145/3130918|pub.1091542401|18;[]|[]|Proceedings of the 1st International Workshop on Multimedia Content Analysis in Sports|2018|||11-19|10.1145/3265845.3265855|pub.1107809717|13;[]|[]|Baltic Journal of Health and Physical Activity|2018|||182-188|10.29359/bjhpa.10.4.17|pub.1112794575|1;[]|[]|Sports Medicine - Open|2019|5|1|28|10.1186/s40798-019-0202-3|pub.1117737457|268;[]|[]|Sensors|2021|21|23|7780|10.3390/s21237780|pub.1143559901|9;[]|[]|2016 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR)|2016|||770-778|10.1109/cvpr.2016.90|pub.1093359587|190939;[]|[]|Communications in Computer and Information Science|2020|1324||17-27|10.1007/978-3-030-64912-8_2|pub.1133374948|28;[]|[]|The 12th Conference of the International Sports Engineering Association|2018|2|6|317|10.3390/proceedings2060317|pub.1101006722|7;[]|[]|2018 IEEE 15th International Conference on Wearable and Implantable Body Sensor Networks (BSN)|2018|||102-105|10.1109/bsn.2018.8329669|pub.1103267777|8;[]|[]|PLOS ONE|2014|9|11|e111730|10.1371/journal.pone.0111730|pub.1021553137|22;[]|[]|Journal of Sports Sciences|2018|37|5|568-600|10.1080/02640414.2018.1521769|pub.1107540315|242;[]|[]|Proceedings of the 25th ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery & Data Mining|2019|||1851-1861|10.1145/3292500.3330758|pub.1119923329|195;[]|[]|Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery|2017|31|6|1678-1705|10.1007/s10618-017-0495-0|pub.1083873422|137;[]|[]|Sensors|2022|22|7|2560|10.3390/s22072560|pub.1146605602|12;[]|[]|2010 20th International Conference on Pattern Recognition|2000|4||152-156 vol.4|10.1109/icpr.2000.902885|pub.1095483002|59;[]|[]|Journal of Biomechanics|2022|139||111139|10.1016/j.jbiomech.2022.111139|pub.1147927363|8;[]|[]|Sensors|2021|21|9|3071|10.3390/s21093071|pub.1137595155|48;[]|[]|IJIIS International Journal of Informatics and Information Systems|2021|4|1|38-54|10.47738/ijiis.v4i1.76|pub.1136838227|24;[]|[]|Journal of Sports Sciences|2012|30|1|53-61|10.1080/02640414.2011.624538|pub.1044389494|56;[]|[]|Frontiers in Sports and Active Living|2021|3||624475|10.3389/fspor.2021.624475|pub.1136743813|93;[]|[]|Sensors|2021|21|18|5996|10.3390/s21185996|pub.1140985993|62;[]|[]|Journal of Human Sport and Exercise|2017|12|Proc2||10.14198/jhse.2017.12.proc2.05|pub.1091468427|91;[]|[]|Journal of Biomechanics|2005|38|5|1055-1065|10.1016/j.jbiomech.2004.05.038|pub.1019857343|72;[]|[]|Proceedings of the 2015 ACM International Symposium on Wearable Computers - ISWC '15|2015|||93-100|10.1145/2802083.2802087|pub.1033777577|84;[]|[]|Sensors|2021|21|16|5318|10.3390/s21165318|pub.1140263172|18;[]|[]|Sensors|2020|20|7|1995|10.3390/s20071995|pub.1126095991|7;[]|[]|2022 IEEE/CVF Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision Workshops (WACVW)|2022|00||682-690|10.1109/wacvw54805.2022.00075|pub.1145639707|12;[]|[]|K[appa]-O[mikron]|2015|||202-202|10.1515/9783110804898-129|pub.1086552467|3441;[]|[]|Journal of Biomechanics|2002|35|8|1059-1069|10.1016/s0021-9290(02)00066-0|pub.1044349847|73;[]|[]|Sensors|2022|22|2|540|10.3390/s22020540|pub.1144600820|8

The increasing volume of data from football events have set up numerous new research paths, and that can assist in the formulation of more informed decisions during match. Expected goals (xG) models can be utilized in different ways to assess performance and designing optimal strategies. This research aims to present a comparative and spatial analysis of some xG models to forecast football shot outcomes. In this context, several important features are employed to train different machine learning models including XGBoost, random forest, k-nearest neighbor (kNN), gradient boosting machines (GBM), multinomial logistic regression and Naïve Bayes (NB) focusing on predicting football shot outcomes to quantify the likelihood of a shot being a goal by the expected goal. The results have shown RF, XGBoost, and kNN performed better in terms of balanced accuracy and Kappa’s benchmark scale. In other words, the results of this analysis can be effective in competitive sports training including player assessment, team analysis and progress tracking, as it could assist football players to enhance their performance.",Italian Statistical Society Series on Advances in Statistics,2025,,,408-414,"Tahir, Sheikh Badar Ud Din",University of Trieste,Italy,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1189770647,0,[]|[]|Journal of Sports Economics|2020|21|4|335-362|10.1177/1527002519897962|pub.1124267545|62;[]|[]|European Journal of Applied Physiology|2015|116|2|373-382|10.1007/s00421-015-3293-7|pub.1019183597|9;[]|[]|Scientific Data|2019|6|1|236|10.1038/s41597-019-0247-7|pub.1122140166|177;[]|[]|Journal of the Royal Statistical Society Series A (General)|1968|131|4|581-585|10.2307/2343726|pub.1103088303|234;[]|[]|Frontiers in Sports and Active Living|2021|3||624475|10.3389/fspor.2021.624475|pub.1136743813|93;[]|[]|Journal of Sports Sciences|2012|31|6|639-676|10.1080/02640414.2012.746720|pub.1023035100|357;[]|[]|German Journal of Exercise and Sport Research|2023|53|4|458-470|10.1007/s12662-023-00900-y|pub.1163353987|13;[]|[]|Statistics|2024|59|2|426-445|10.1080/02331888.2024.2445305|pub.1183882892|5

pub.1164485765,10.1007/978-3-031-42430-4_29,Improving the Expected Goal Value in Football Using Multilayer Perceptron Networks,"The development of big data and machine learning is having a special boost in the field of innovation in sports. Football is the most popular sport in Europe with millions of players and billions of euros invested. Currently, machine learning applications in football are focused on video analysis to events detection (tracking of players, statistics matches, scouting, ...), injuries evaluation and prediction, among others. The xG metric (Expected Goals) determines the probability that a shot will result in a goal and is often displayed on screen during the most important football matches in the world. In this paper we present a new model to obtain more accurate predictions of the probability of a shot becoming a goal. The model is based on a multi-layer perceptron neural network (MLP), which allows the interaction of different variables and improves the model’s performance. Our proposal includes an evaluation of the quality and a comparison with the xG provided by statsbomb, one of the most important football data providers of the world. The results show that our model outperforms the quality of the expectations provided by statsbomb.

pub.1154955997,10.48550/arxiv.2301.13052,A Machine Learning Approach for Player and Position Adjusted Expected Goals in Football (Soccer),"Football is a very result-driven industry, with goals being rarer than in most sports, so having further parameters to judge the performance of teams and individuals is key. Expected Goals (xG) allow further insight than just a scoreline. To tackle the need for further analysis in football, this paper uses machine learning applications that are developed and applied to Football Event data. From the concept, a Binary Classification problem is created whereby a probabilistic valuation is outputted using Logistic Regression and Gradient Boosting based approaches. The model successfully predicts xGs probability values for football players based on 15,575 shots. The proposed solution utilises StatsBomb as the data provider and an industry benchmark to tune the models in the right direction. The proposed ML solution for xG is further used to tackle the age-old cliche of: 'the ball has fallen to the wrong guy there'. The development of the model is used to adjust and gain more realistic values of expected goals than the general models show. To achieve this, this paper tackles Positional Adjusted xG, splitting the training data into Forward, Midfield, and Defence with the aim of providing insight into player qualities based on their positional sub-group. Positional Adjusted xG successfully predicts and proves that more attacking players are better at accumulating xG. The highest value belonged to Forwards followed by Midfielders and Defenders. Finally, this study has further developments into Player Adjusted xG with the aim of proving that Messi is statistically at a higher efficiency level than the average footballer. This is achieved by using Messi subset samples to quantify his qualities in comparison to the average xG models finding that Messi xG performs 347 xG higher than the general model outcome.",arXiv,2023,,,,"Hewitt, James H.; Karakuş, Oktay",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1154955997,2,

Machine learning (ML) has become a vital tool in analyzing player performance, especially in identifying leading goal scorers and highly effective goalkeepers. This research focuses on understanding how team statistics influence goals and saves, examining not only individual player metrics but also the relationship between team attacks, team goals, and the impact of each player's threatening attacks on their goal-scoring output. Additionally, metrics related to goals conceded by the team were analyzed to establish any correlation with the number of saves made by goalkeepers. The study aims to predict the top goal scorer and the best goalkeeper using seven ML models: Random Forest, XG Boost, Linear Regression, K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Decision Trees, Support Vector Regression (SVR), and Gradient Boosting. Data was gathered through web scraping and API integration from five major leagues: La Liga, Bundesliga, Premier League, Ligue 1, and Serie A covering the seasons from 2017/2018 to 2022/2023. The models' performance was assessed using statistical measures like Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), R-Squared (R2), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE). Findings indicate that XG Boost performed best for predicting goal scorers, while Linear Regression was most effective for forecasting goalkeeper saves.

The change in fans opinions are reflected in a series of tweets written by fans. This research work focuses on identifying and analyzing sentiment in tweets expressed by football fans on Twitter. To perform sentiment analysis, we analyzed different word embedding techniques to represent word vectors that capture semantic and syntactic information. In this paper, we use a global vector(GloVe) word embedding technique which produces word vector with substructure and leverages statistics. In addition to GloVe, we also construct a sentiment lexicon as additional information. The word vector produced by GloVe and sentiment lexicon is the inputs for the proposed hybrid CNN-LSTM deep learning model. The proposed CNN-LSTM model blend benefits of CNN and LSTM, CNN used to excerpt features from word embedding that reflect short-term sentiment dependency while LSTM used to build long-term sentiment relationships among words. This the paper also used machine learning algorithms such as Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, Multinomial Nave Bayes, KNearest Neighbours(KNN) and XG Boost for sentiment analysis and sentiment classification. We evaluated the performance of proposed hybrid CNN-LSTM with GloVe word embedding approach with 2018 FIFA world cup tweets dataset, our experiment results show 85.46% and 92.56% validation and testing accuracy respectively.

This study compares the predictive accuracy and feature importance of two prominent xG models: Opta and Understat. Using data from the top five European leagues from the 2017-2018 to the 2023-2024 seasons, we evaluate the predictive accuracy of each model using L1 and L2 loss metrics. Our findings indicate that Understat outperforms Opta in terms of lower prediction errors in the Bundesliga, Premier League, and Serie A, while Opta yields more stable predictions in La Liga and Ligue 1. We further analyze the factors influencing xG predictions through feature importance techniques using Random Forest and XGBoost models, complemented by SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) analysis. Results reveal that goal exposure angle, shooting angle, and shot distance are key features in predicting goal probability, with differences in how categorical variables are weighted between the models. The study concludes with a discussion of the strengths, limitations, and league-specific applications of both models, highlighting the need for standardized data collection practices and expanded contextual features to enhance xG model utility and accuracy.",Applied and Computational Engineering,2024,117,1,1-10,"Fu, Siheng",Renmin University of China,China,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1183698563,1,

Football attracts millions of fans worldwide, creating lucrative opportunities for advertising and marketing. In Europe, the Big Five leagues represent most of the European professional sports market. In this context, it is important to be able to evaluate football clubs and players. The value of a football player depends mainly on his performance, which depends on different factors, such as personal characteristics, attacking and defending ability on the pitch, mentality, and much more. This study focuses on attacking performance, specifically Expected Goals (xG), a critical metric for financial and strategic decisions in football, since it helps clubs, investors, and bookmakers to evaluate more accurately team performance and identify value bets. In addition, the xG metric can also significantly influence a player’s market value and transfer decisions.

Based on previous years’ performance, we predict the number of goals that players scored during the 2021–22 season. To achieve this, we collected advanced statistics for players from five major European Leagues: the English Premier League, the Spanish La Liga, the German Bundesliga, the French Ligue1 and the Italian Serie A, for seasons from 2017–18 up to 2021–22. Additionally, we used one-season lag features, and three supervised Machine Learning (ML) algorithms for experimental benchmarking: Linear Regression (LR), Random Forest (RF) and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP). Furthermore, we compared these models based on their performance. All models’ results are auspicious and comparable to each other. LR was the best performing model with Mean Absolute Error (MAE) 1.60, Mean Squared Error (MSE) 7.06 and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) 2.66. Based on feature importance analysis, we established that every player’s upcoming scoring performance is strongly associated with previous season’s goals (Gls) and expected goals (xG).",IFIP Advances in Information and Communication Technology,2023,676,,304-315,"Giannakoulas, Nikolaos; Papageorgiou, George; Tjortjis, Christos",International Hellenic University,Greece,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1158504594,6,"[]|[]|2017 Ninth International Conference on Advanced Computing (ICoAC)|2017|00||242-246|10.1109/icoac.2017.8441301|pub.1106345258|4;[]|[]|2019 10th International Conference on Information, Intelligence, Systems and Applications (IISA)|2019|00||1-4|10.1109/iisa.2019.8900754|pub.1122592441|53;[]|[]|Geoscientific Model Development|2014|7|3|1247-1250|10.5194/gmd-7-1247-2014|pub.1035289512|4484;[]|[]|2020 11th International Conference on Information, Intelligence, Systems and Applications (IISA|2020|00||1-8|10.1109/iisa50023.2020.9284352|pub.1133472695|33;[]|[]|Computer Networks|2020|166||106980|10.1016/j.comnet.2019.106980|pub.1122305413|96;[]|[]|Procedia Computer Science|2019|161||466-474|10.1016/j.procs.2019.11.146|pub.1123796155|271;[]|[]|IFIP Advances in Information and Communication Technology|2022|647||360-372|10.1007/978-3-031-08337-2_30|pub.1148730318|17;[]|[]|Information Systems|2022|109||102054|10.1016/j.is.2022.102054|pub.1147375086|21;[]|[]|Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery|2019|9|4||10.1002/widm.1307|pub.1113158197|61;[]|[]|Information Systems|2021|99||101750|10.1016/j.is.2021.101750|pub.1135552368|50;[]|[]|2018 Second International Conference on Electronics, Communication and Aerospace Technology (ICECA)|2018|00||1148-1153|10.1109/iceca.2018.8474750|pub.1107391329|15;[]|[]|Scientific American|1992|267|3|144-51|10.1038/scientificamerican0992-144|pub.1056600980|355;[]|[]|Advances in Data Analysis and Classification|2016|11|2|353-370|10.1007/s11634-016-0246-x|pub.1049716423|28;[]|[]|Climate Research|2005|30||79-82|10.3354/cr030079|pub.1071159684|4426;[]|[]|2021 2nd International Conference for Emerging Technology (INCET)|2021|00||1-5|10.1109/incet51464.2021.9456424|pub.1139099790|9;[]|[]|2016 IEEE 16th International Conference on Data Mining Workshops (ICDMW)|2016|||144-151|10.1109/icdmw.2016.0028|pub.1094331040|4;[]|[]|Nature Biotechnology|2008|26|2|195-197|10.1038/nbt1386|pub.1045224415|673;[]|[]|IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems|2009|20|12|1911-1922|10.1109/tnn.2009.2032543|pub.1061717616|82;[]|[]|2019 6th Swiss Conference on Data Science (SDS)|2019|00||111-112|10.1109/sds.2019.00009|pub.1120201840|4;[]|[]|2019 SoutheastCon|2019|00||1-9|10.1109/southeastcon42311.2019.9020560|pub.1125460434|34;[]|[]|2019 International Conference on Computational Intelligence in Data Science (ICCIDS)|2019|00||1-5|10.1109/iccids.2019.8862140|pub.1121663258|135;[]|[]|IEEE Access|2022|10||22631-22645|10.1109/access.2022.3154767|pub.1145850264|60"

Additionally, we present a novel framework to assess and compare the performance dynamics of two teams during a match, while accounting for evolving match scores.

pub.1182295560,10.3390/app142210390,Beyond xG: A Dual Prediction Model for Analyzing Player Performance Through Expected and Actual Goals in European Soccer Leagues,"Soccer is evolving into a science rather than just a sport, driven by intense competition between professional teams. This transformation requires efforts beyond physical training, including strategic planning, data analysis, and advanced metrics. Coaches and teams increasingly use sophisticated methods and data-driven insights to enhance decision-making. Analyzing team performance is crucial to prepare players and coaches, enabling targeted training and strategic adjustments. Expected goals (xG) analysis plays a key role in assessing team and individual player performance, providing nuanced insights into on-field actions and opportunities. This approach allows coaches to optimize tactics and lineup choices beyond traditional scorelines. However, relying solely on xG might not provide a full picture of player performance, as a higher xG does not always translate into more goals due to the intricacies and variabilities of in-game situations. This paper seeks to refine performance assessments by incorporating predictions for both expected goals (xG) and actual goals (aG). Using this new model, we consider a wider variety of factors to provide a more comprehensive evaluation of players and teams. Another major focus of our study is to present a method for selecting and categorizing players based on their predicted xG and aG performance. Additionally, this paper discusses expected goals and actual goals for each individual game; consequently, we use expected goals per game (xGg) and actual goals per game (aGg) to reflect them. Moreover, we employ regression machine learning models, particularly ridge regression, which demonstrates strong performance in forecasting xGg and aGg, outperforming other models in our comparative assessment. Ridge regression’s ability to handle overlapping and correlated variables makes it an ideal choice for our analysis. This approach improves prediction accuracy and provides actionable insights for coaches and analysts to optimize team performance. By using constructed features from various methods in the dataset, we improve our model’s performance by as much as 12%. These features offer a more detailed understanding of player performance in specific leagues and roles, improving the model’s accuracy from 83% to nearly 95%, as indicated by the R-squared metric. Furthermore, our research introduces a player selection methodology based on their predicted xG and aG, as determined by our proposed model. According to our model’s classification, we categorize top players into two groups: efficient scorers and consistent performers.

To do this, a new original sample of 7801 shots from Italy's Serie A (1 binary outcome and 26 features) for the 2022/2023 and 2023/2024 seasons were used, in which 8 new features of various types were introduced, integrating event data, performance data, and tracking data. Specifically, the performance of 8 statistical and machine learning (algorithmic) classifiers was compared. The focus was on two key aspects related to the field of explainable Artificial Intelligence (xAI), ‘accuracy’ and ‘explainability’, assessed using some appropriate metrics. Considering the accuracy metrics, among the statistical classifiers Binary Regression (BR) with the cloglog link function is the most effective. In contrast, among the algorithmic classifiers, xGBoost has the best performance but is slightly lower than the BR-cloglog. Regarding explainability, the primary contribution to the xG consistently comes from a small set of variables across all classifiers. The most influential features are the proximity to the goal, the shooting angle, and the shooter's visual angle.",Statistics,2024,59,2,426-445,"Cefis, Mattia; Carpita, Maurizio",University of Brescia,Italy,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1183882892,5,"[]|[]|Journal of the Operational Research Society|2024|76|1|1-13|10.1080/01605682.2024.2323669|pub.1169255691|6;[]|[]|Classroom Companion: Business|2021||||10.1007/978-3-030-80519-7|pub.1142369633|6288;[]|[]|Expert Systems with Applications|2025|259||125239|10.1016/j.eswa.2024.125239|pub.1175167945|47;[]|[]|Communications in Computer and Information Science|2020|1324||17-27|10.1007/978-3-030-64912-8_2|pub.1133374948|28;[]|[]|Proceedings of the 22nd ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining|2016|||785-794|10.1145/2939672.2939785|pub.1021899069|35156;[]|[]|Machine Learning|1995|20|3|273-297|10.1007/bf00994018|pub.1025150743|42614;[]|[]|Computational Statistics|2022|39|1|93-116|10.1007/s00180-022-01295-4|pub.1152057608|13;[]|[]|Contributions to the Theory of Games (AM-28), Volume II|1953|||307-318|10.1515/9781400881970-018|pub.1004828484|3855;[]|[]|Statistical Science|2001|16|3||10.1214/ss/1009213726|pub.1037292812|3666;[]|[]|International Journal of Computer Science in Sport|2023|22|2|49-61|10.2478/ijcss-2023-0010|pub.1164089592|4;[]|[]|Annals of Operations Research|2022|325|1|441-465|10.1007/s10479-022-04653-z|pub.1147080141|17;[]|[]|College Mathematics Journal|1986|17|4|326-337|10.1080/07468342.1986.11972974|pub.1100716748|223;[]|[]|Journal of Sports Analytics|2018|4|3|165-174|10.3233/jsa-170207|pub.1103629864|16;[]|[]|Frontiers in Sports and Active Living|2024|6||1348983|10.3389/fspor.2024.1348983|pub.1172843720|6;[]|[]|Journal of the Royal Statistical Society Series D (The Statistician)|1999|48|1|85-94|10.1111/1467-9884.00173|pub.1016516305|156;[]|[]|Nature Communications|2024|15|1|1906|10.1038/s41467-024-45965-x|pub.1169851271|42;[]|[]|Journal of Human Sport and Exercise|2017|12|Proc2||10.14198/jhse.2017.12.proc2.05|pub.1091468427|91;[]|[]|Journal of the Operational Research Society|2022|74|7|1690-1711|10.1080/01605682.2022.2110001|pub.1150328335|13;[]|[]|Nature|1986|323|6088|533-536|10.1038/323533a0|pub.1018367015|23033;[]|[]|ACM Transactions on Intelligent Systems and Technology|2019|10|5|1-27|10.1145/3343172|pub.1121096046|114;[]|[]|Studies in individual differences: The search for intelligence.|1961|||45-58|10.1037/11491-005|pub.1046737294|362;[]|[]|2022 IEEE 9th International Conference on Data Science and Advanced Analytics (DSAA)|2022|00||1-9|10.1109/dsaa54385.2022.10032440|pub.1155230621|21;[]|[]|Finance Research Letters|2023|56||104088|10.1016/j.frl.2023.104088|pub.1159793227|87;[]|[]|Journal of Applied Statistics|2022|50|15|3088-3107|10.1080/02664763.2022.2101044|pub.1149557714|7;[]|[]||2015||||10.1201/b18401|pub.1108475210|2273;[]|[]|Statistics|2024|59|2|330-353|10.1080/02331888.2024.2434904|pub.1182872373|15;[]|[]|IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering|2009|21|9|1263-1284|10.1109/tkde.2008.239|pub.1061661916|7528;[]|[]|BMC Genomics|2020|21|1|6|10.1186/s12864-019-6413-7|pub.1123786681|4368;[]|[]|Advances in Data Analysis and Classification|2024|19|1|67-93|10.1007/s11634-023-00574-2|pub.1168020031|26;[]|[]|Wiley Series in Probability and Statistics|1980||||10.1002/0471725153|pub.1109700913|8711;[]|[]|Frontiers in Psychology|2022|13||899199|10.3389/fpsyg.2022.899199|pub.1148375373|9;[]|[]|International Journal of Epidemiology|2010|39|5|1137-1150|10.1093/ije/dyq191|pub.1042681700|503;[]|[]|Wiley Series in Probability and Statistics|2013||||10.1002/9781118548387|pub.1106875674|10738;[]|[]|Physical Therapy in Sport|2024|69||15-21|10.1016/j.ptsp.2024.06.007|pub.1173467520|3;[]|[]|Quality Technology & Quantitative Management|2015|12|4|561-577|10.1080/16843703.2015.11673436|pub.1026374456|34;[]|[]|Frontiers in Sports and Active Living|2021|3||624475|10.3389/fspor.2021.624475|pub.1136743813|93;[]|[]|Scientific Data|2024|11|1|553|10.1038/s41597-024-03386-x|pub.1172217796|4;[]|[]|Scientific Reports|2024|14|1|2596|10.1038/s41598-024-53223-9|pub.1168402980|3;[]|[]|Journal of Applied Statistics|2020|48|9|1696-1711|10.1080/02664763.2020.1772210|pub.1127978149|12;[]|[]|Machine Learning|2001|45|1|5-32|10.1023/a:1010933404324|pub.1024739340|102869;[]|[]|Statistics|2024|58|3|478-480|10.1080/02331888.2024.2364687|pub.1172988583|1;[]|[]|Statistical Modelling|2019|19|1|74-101|10.1177/1471082x18810971|pub.1111352278|43;[]|[]||2021||||10.1201/9780429027192|pub.1134389326|337"

pub.1130897758,10.1007/978-3-030-59491-6_13,Comparing State-of-the-Art Neural Network Ensemble Methods in Soccer Predictions,"For many reasons, including sports being one of the main forms of entertainment in the world, online gambling is growing. And in growing markets, opportunities to explore it arise. In this paper, neural network ensemble approaches, such as bagging, random subspace sampling, negative correlation learning and the simple averaging of predictions, are compared. For each one of these methods, several combinations of input parameters are evaluated. We used only the expected goals metric as predictors since it is able to have good predictive power while keeping the computational demands low. These models are compared in the soccer (also known as association football) betting context where we have access to metrics, such as rentability, to analyze the results in multiple perspectives. The results show that the optimal solution is goal-dependent, with the ensemble methods being able to increase the accuracy up to +3 % over the best single model. The biggest improvement over the single model was obtained by averaging dropout networks.",Lecture Notes in Computer Science,2020,12117,,139-149,"Mendes-Neves, Tiago; Mendes-Moreira, João",Institute for Systems and Computer Engineering of Porto; University of Porto,Portugal,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1130897758,7,[]|[]|Machine Learning|2018|108|1|77-95|10.1007/s10994-018-5741-1|pub.1105950062|40;[]|[]|Machine Learning|2018|108|1|1-7|10.1007/s10994-018-5763-8|pub.1107428418|31;[]|[]|Journal of Biomedical Informatics|2018|86||25-32|10.1016/j.jbi.2018.08.006|pub.1106086588|369;[]|[]|Knowledge-Based Systems|2013|50||60-86|10.1016/j.knosys.2013.05.008|pub.1052731810|42;[]|[]|Cybernetics and Systems Analysis|2005|41|4|619-630|10.1007/s10559-005-0098-4|pub.1053186569|64;[]|[]||2018||||10.1007/978-3-319-94463-0|pub.1109581194|1774;[]|[]|Big Data Research|2018|14||112-120|10.1016/j.bdr.2018.10.001|pub.1107530041|9;[]|[]|Machine Learning|2018|108|1|9-28|10.1007/s10994-018-5726-0|pub.1105466035|50;[]|[]|Fifth International Conference on Information Technology: New Generations (itng 2008)|2008|||1194-1197|10.1109/itng.2008.203|pub.1094020147|79;[]|[]|Machine Learning|2018|108|1|29-47|10.1007/s10994-018-5704-6|pub.1103780181|69;[]|[]|Machine Learning|2018|108|1|49-75|10.1007/s10994-018-5703-7|pub.1103789258|74;[]|[]|Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence|2019|82||272-281|10.1016/j.engappai.2019.03.012|pub.1113955520|134;[]|[]|Knowledge-Based Systems|2006|19|7|544-553|10.1016/j.knosys.2006.04.011|pub.1020306165|113;[]|[]|Neural Networks|1999|12|10|1399-1404|10.1016/s0893-6080(99)00073-8|pub.1016620184|538
pub.1186554678,10.48550/arxiv.2503.09737,Unveiling Hidden Pivotal Players with GoalNet: A GNN-Based Soccer Player Evaluation System,"Soccer analysis tools emphasize metrics such as expected goals, leading to an overrepresentation of attacking players' contributions and overlooking players who facilitate ball control and link attacks. Examples include Rodri from Manchester City and Palhinha who just transferred to Bayern Munich. To address this bias, we aim to identify players with pivotal roles in a soccer team, incorporating both spatial and temporal features.   In this work, we introduce a GNN-based framework that assigns individual credit for changes in expected threat (xT), thus capturing overlooked yet vital contributions in soccer. Our pipeline encodes both spatial and temporal features in event-centric graphs, enabling fair attribution of non-scoring actions such as defensive or transitional plays. We incorporate centrality measures into the learned player embeddings, ensuring that ball-retaining defenders and defensive midfielders receive due recognition for their overall impact. Furthermore, we explore diverse GNN variants-including Graph Attention Networks and Transformer-based models-to handle long-range dependencies and evolving match contexts, discussing their relative performance and computational complexity. Experiments on real match data confirm the robustness of our approach in highlighting pivotal roles that traditional attacking metrics typically miss, underscoring the model's utility for more comprehensive soccer analytics.",arXiv,2025,,,,"Jiang, Jacky Hao; Cai, Jerry; Kyrillidis, Anastasios",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1186554678,0,[]|[]|2017 IEEE Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV)|2017|||464-472|10.1109/wacv.2017.58|pub.1093211855|2086;[]|[]|2015 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)|2015|||1026-1034|10.1109/iccv.2015.123|pub.1093828312|16505;[]|[]|Nature Communications|2024|15|1|1906|10.1038/s41467-024-45965-x|pub.1169851271|42;[]|[]|Neural Networks|1998|11|4|761-767|10.1016/s0893-6080(98)00010-0|pub.1024491244|798;[]|[]|Social Networks|1991|13|2|141-154|10.1016/0378-8733(91)90017-n|pub.1008957340|819;[]|[]|Proceedings of the 25th ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery & Data Mining|2019|||1851-1861|10.1145/3292500.3330758|pub.1119923329|195;[]|[]|Advances in Intelligent Systems Research|2017||||10.2991/msam-17.2017.68|pub.1097023800|370

Potential applications of AI are currently being used in many sectors. However, the usage of AI has been very limited in sports science compared to the other sectors. In this study, we developed an artificial neural network model to estimate the market values of the players in the Turkish Super Football League. While the market value was selected as an output, the input values were: minutes played; goals scored; xG: assists; xA; defensive duels won %; tackle success %; shots on target %; Short-middle pass accuracy %; long pass accuracy %; and accuracy of passes to penalty area. After creating a neural network based on the input-output values with high training, validation and testing statistical values, input values were computed with the neural network created and then the output values were estimated. In conclusion, an artificial neural network is becoming one of the important modeling methods in all areas of life. Although the application of artificial neural networks is very limited in sports science, it is one of the suitable science disciplines where there is a lot of statistical data. The methodology proposed in this paper can also be used for talent selection in football. Moreover, it may help stop criticism by TV sports programmes and newspapers because market value estimation is based on fair performance parameters. Further studies are strongly recommended, not only for football but also for other sports disciplines.",Applied Artificial Intelligence,2021,35,13,1022-1042,"Inan, Tugbay; Cavas, Levent",Dokuz Eylül

We take a look at it from a previously unseen perspective and analyze if there are differences between four different levels in German football (Bundesliga, Regionalliga, U19 Bundesliga and U17 Bundesliga) in shooting tendencies and efficiency and explore how these change as players get older. To do that we employ statistical analysis and examine the individual weights of Expected Goals models based on logistic regression. We find that players in higher levels tend to be more risky and aim for corners of the goal and are more predictable in terms of their shot origins. A comparison of headers and kicks show that goal likelihood of the latter is much more influenced by whether a shot has happened after a set piece, whereas goal likelihood of headers decreases more steeply with increasing distance from goal. Analysis also reveals that with increasing level goalkeepers tend to be more reliable saving shots at medium height but have a harder time with shots aimed at bottom corners.",Communications in Computer and Information Science,2023,1783,,14-26,"Raudonius, Laurynas; Seidl, Thomas","ETH Zurich; VfB Stuttgart, 1893 AG, Mercedesstraße 109, 70372, Stuttgart, Germany",Switzerland,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1155713307,4,[]|[]|Sustainability|2021|13|14|7713|10.3390/su13147713|pub.1139624413|21;[]|[]|Journal of Human Kinetics|2011|27|2011|135-146|10.2478/v10078-011-0011-3|pub.1050829871|217;[]|[]|Monthly Weather Review|1950|78|1|1-3|10.1175/1520-0493(1950)078<0001:vofeit>2.0.co;2|pub.1063450417|4227;[]|[]|Sports|2019|7|4|79|10.3390/sports7040079|pub.1113227044|34;[]|[]|Chance|2009|22|4|21-28|10.1080/09332480.2009.10722979|pub.1006715048|2;[]|[]|Scientific Data|2019|6|1|236|10.1038/s41597-019-0247-7|pub.1122140166|177;[]|[]|Journal of the Royal Statistical Society Series D (The Statistician)|1997|46|4|541-550|10.1111/1467-9884.00108|pub.1014061448|124;[]|[]|Journal of Human Sport and Exercise|2017|12|Proc2||10.14198/jhse.2017.12.proc2.05|pub.1091468427|91;[]|[]|Wiley Series in Probability and Statistics|1998||||10.1002/9781118625590|pub.1106830803|5992;[]|[]|Journal of Sports Science and Medicine|2010|9|2|288-93||pub.1078802707|256;[]|[]|PLOS ONE|2016|11|12|e0168768|10.1371/journal.pone.0168768|pub.1026968426|111;[]|[]|Journal of Human Kinetics|2012|31|2012|137-147|10.2478/v10078-012-0015-7|pub.1029090697|271;[]|[]|Communications in Computer and Information Science|2020|1324||17-27|10.1007/978-3-030-64912-8_2|pub.1133374948|28;[]|[]|The Journals of Gerontology Series B|2013|69|6|870-880|10.1093/geronb/gbt081|pub.1029259895|238;[]|[]|Journal of Economic Behavior & Organization|2015|112||112-126|10.1016/j.jebo.2015.01.004|pub.1030787558|115
pub.1188585005,10.1016/j.jcmds.2025.100115,Crafting a Player Impact Metric through analysis of football match event data,"The evaluation of football players remains a challenging task due to the limitations of existing rating models as well as the diverse nature of in-game actions and their varying impact on outcome of the matches, which often emphasize offensive actions while overlooking key defensive and strategic contributions. While some player impact metrics exist for football, their effectiveness, complete in-depth analysis, and relationship with match outcomes (win, loss, draw) has not been studied well. In this study, we have developed a Player Impact Metric (PIM) that provides a more comprehensive and data-driven assessment of player performance by incorporating match event data, Expected Goals (xG), Expected Threat (xT), and defensive contributions. The PIM framework assigns weighted scores to player actions using ordinal logistic regression based on their influence on match outcomes. The model evaluates player contributions using event-level data, integrating both offensive and defensive actions. The dataset is sourced from WhoScored, with structured data processing in PostgreSQL and analytical modeling techniques applied to derive impact scores. The PIM was tested against WhoScored Ratings, revealing notable differences in player rankings, particularly for defensive players. Our findings show that PIM provides a more balanced assessment, capturing critical non-scoring contributions that traditional rating systems tend to undervalue.

pub.1150208812,10.1145/3534678.3539138,Seq2Event: Learning the Language of Soccer Using Transformer-based Match Event Prediction,"Soccer is a sport characterised by open and dynamic play, with player actions and roles aligned according to team strategies simultaneously and at multiple temporal scales with high spatial freedom. This complexity presents an analytics challenge, which to date has largely been solved by decomposing the game according to specific criteria to analyse specific problems. We propose a more holistic approach, utilising Transformer or RNN components in the novel Seq2Event model, in which the next match event is predicted given prior match events and context. We show metric creation using a general purpose context-aware model as a deployable practical application, and demonstrate development of the poss-util metric using a Seq2Event model. Summarising the expectation of key attacking events (shot, cross) during each possession, our metric is shown to correlate over matches (r=0.91, n=190) with the popular xG metric. Example practical application of poss-util to analyse behaviour over possessions and matches is made.

pub.1169542680,10.1109/punecon58714.2023.10450054,Multi Criteria Decision Making in Fantasy Sports,"Football is a very famous sport worldwide and continues gaining traction to this day. As the interest in the game rises, so do the methods of interacting with the game. One such avenue is the FPL (Football Premier League). Recent years have seen a huge spike in interest for virtual, fantasy playing applications like the FPL. A person participating is usually heavily biased towards certain players or teams. This inherent bias causes them to make certain irrational decisions which may not provide the best results. There exists a huge gap in the market for an algorithm-based approach to team selection and the aim of this research is to make an optimal application capable of filling that void. The premise of this research is to create a team recommender system that optimizes one's team selection strategy for the FPL. This research works by introducing objectivity and eliminating biases in the team selection process. It incorporates the usage of TOPSIS (Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution) and criteria-based metrics along with an XG-Boost regression predictor, with the aim of filling the gaps in the current systems and to maximize the returns while minimizing the cost associated with it. The approach implemented involved the usage of XGBoost, yielding a standard deviation of 0.041188.",2023 IEEE Pune Section International Conference (PuneCon),2023,00,,1-6,"Shah, Dhruvi; Kapadia, Parth; Kakwani, Himanshu; Dabre, Kanchan",Dwarkadas J.
